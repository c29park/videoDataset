      "page_content": "jaming  bread can I get the lights please I'm  Rachel zler I'm going to teach you the  basics to become the greatest singer in  the world or wherever you  live this is singing 101 step number one  warm up the most important thing to do  is to warm up your voice in any capacity  whenever you are going to use it and the  way to do that is usually through bit of  lip trills going up and down the  [Music]  scale and then you go  up I like to warm up for about 30  minutes people think that you can only  just warm up for 5 to 10 if you have a  certain warmup that works for you that  way go for it but if you're going to be  doing some strenuous activity say doing  a Shakespeare play eight times a week or  singing a Disney score for 87 takes in  an hour you should warm up for a really  long time make sure that you're not  overdoing it but also don't underdo it  cuz both things can be really  detrimental to your voice in the long  run it's a muscle treat it like a muscle  that you're working out treat it like  rolling out before going on a run it's  the same thing and it's also very easily  damaged very easily injured and you  don't want to do that if you ever gone  out to karaoke which I do not and your  voice feels hurt strained grally groggy  the next day it's probably cuz you  didn't warm  up so the next time you're doing Silver  Springs by Fleet Mac at your favorite  karaoke bar 20 minutes of vocal trolls  on the way there the taxi driver will  thank you and your Uber rating will go  down step number two find your voice  this could also be referred to as  placement where are you placing your  voice in a song A lot of times that has  to do with a character that you're  playing if you're doing musical theater  the way that I have for most of my life  I feel Prett  so I feel pretty andt and bright or even  if it just means you're not sure where  to place certain things in your voice  when you're singing your favorite Sarah  Barella song in the car there's a real  misconception about singing that it's  all here not at all you have something  called chest voice which feels like it's  coming from here you have something  called Head voice which feels like it's  coming from here or people use a nice  mix which feels like you're doing both  at the same time A lot of times my vocal  coach Joan later has had me equate  sounds to animals so a lot of times  you'll be doing like something like a  goose being like  that's your chest sometimes you're doing  things and it's like a little mouse  where you're  going that's your head voice anywhere in  between that is a mix but that does take  a long time to kind of figure out  because we have something called the  pagio in our voice that is when you are  switching from your chest to your head  it's a very sensitive point in the scale  that you're using while you're singing a  lot of times it takes a lot of training  in order to iron out your pagio so it's  not as easily noticeable when you're  singing a song but there are ways to  flip through both so all of those things  very simplified can be seen as yodeling  so when you're yodeling if you just go  like is a very donkey sounding quality  to your voice but you're going from your  head to your chest and that actually  requires a lot of skill a lot of people  actually can't achieve that which is why  yodeling is such a amazing skill when  you see Julie Andrews doing up on the  hill was a lonely goat herd  [Music]  speaking of Sound of Music if you're  going to sing in your chest voice you  want to do do me do me that's in your  chest if you're doing your head voice it  would  be that's in your head but there are  ways to mix that so it sounds more like  you're tricking the audience into  thinking you are belting but it's much  healthier for you because in order to  Belt something like that requires some  crazy skill and also a lot of strain if  done too many times or done improperly  or without warming up so a lot of times  you'll want to  mix D me it's a mix of both I'm not  fully in my chest I'm not fully in my  head but I am using both in order to  achieve a certain sound quality that I  want to step number three  style and not the song by Taylor Swift  though we love that song it's very  important when you are singing to  understand what you're singing for that  sometimes means understanding your  audience or understanding the material  to a certain degree do you want to sing  it like a pop star do you want to sing  it like a rock star do you want to sing  it like Creed do you want to S it like  you're doing Opera for the 18th time  it's very important to understand that  stylistic quality because that affects  the way that the audience is perceiving  your performance it also affects what  you have to do with your voice a lot of  Pop starss nowadays have many different  styles we have lady gagas and Chapel Ron  in the world who use a very a chesty  voice and at times a very musical theery  approach to singing also Chapel has a  yodel quality to her voice which is  really amazing but if you were going to  be singing in a pop style sometimes  people are singing in as what the  internet dubs incursive and that's what  a lot of pop stars do as well it's very  easy on the voice but it also um is a  very hard thing to come across and make  sure that you are doing it dynamically  make sure that you're doing it with  diction so that people understand what  you're saying but it would sound a  little bit  like female dear Ray a drop of Golden  Sun that's more of like a billy eyelish  approach to singing a song like that  it's just a beautiful quality to her  voice she can do so much vocal  gymnastics with what she does in all of  her different  [Music]  records man my Gra yes but then if you  were going to do a very operatic sense a  lot of that has to do with the amount  that you use your jaw it also has to do  with your tongue placement a lot of  opera singers actually bring their  tongue to the very back of their throat  while they're  [Music]  singing this is also common for a lot of  musical theater singers because in order  to achieve eight shows a week in proper  voice you have to treat it like an opera  a lot of opera singers really do treat  their voice with so much care because  you have to be able to sing for hours  and hours and hours so if you were going  to sing me name I call myself far long  long way to  run that would be in your Opera quality  and then you know there are ways to add  gravel rasp to your voice nasality that  will bring certain Rock sounds that will  bring certain pop sounds I definitely  think that there's an element to Creed  songs that we call yling which like  really is like going into the gravel of  your voice I don't recommend doing that  solely because it does require a lot of  skill in order to do it without hurting  yourself if you ever need an example of  somebody who was doing everything right  with their voice eight times a week it  was Alex Brightman in the musical  Beetlejuice doing the Michael Keaton  Beetlejuice voice while singing dancing  doing acrobatics and all of these stunts  but did it eight times a week stay in  your seat I do this bull like eight  times a week that requires an insane  amount of training do not try that at  Home Step four add Sparkle there are  times where you get to make things your  own there are times where you get to  sing de fale dear it's fun it's  wonderful it's not necessarily what you  would be doing if you were playing Maria  von trap on Broadway but it's still  really fun to do so if if you want to do  that I think this is a free world and  you should absolutely feel free to sing  however you want V is your breath  control so if you feel like you can  absolutely go for it I learned how to do  V by listening to Sutton boster sing  gimme gimme from Thoroughly Modern  Millie and astonishing from Little Women  on repeat I would mimic her and that's  the way I learned how to do it I didn't  learn the traditional way so  unfortunately I'm not necessarily the  best person to teach it cuz I just  copied my favorite musical theater  actress step number five sing now you  have the opportunity to put all of these  things together know that you've warmed  up your body so you know where in your  body your voice is coming from make sure  that you're doing everything healthily  and safely it's very very important to  take care of this muscle it is very  sensitive it's very delicate and you  don't want to hurt it obviously your  next step is to find the style are you  singing a musical theater song are you  singing a pop song are you singing a  rock song make sure that everything that  you're doing for that makes you feel  comfortable makes you feel awesome and  then you get to just add your Sparkle  and then you sit sing anybody have a  question anybody in the  class which song which song in Snow  White was your favorite to sing oh  that's a good one there is a song in act  three of the movie where Snow White  returns to her kingdom in an attempt to  get it back it's called Snow White  returns and it wasn't originally in the  film until very very late in the game it  was the 11th Hour pic and Paul wrote it  for me to sing cuz we just felt the  scene was missing something and it  really just became  the anthem of the film and the Heart of  it truly um the lyric that moves me the  most is no more sending Whispers to the  water cuz you're everything you were  wishing and waiting  for everybody needs to hear that that  the person you want to be has been  within you the entire time I'm very  proud to have been a part of that  process and uh it brings my heart a lot  of Joy now it's your turn  I'm so proud of you you did it and even  though I'm not qualified to teach how to  sing I've been doing it for a very long  time because it brings a lot of joy to  my heart as I hope it does for you as  well thanks so much for coming to my  class y'all",

Reynolds this is huge Jack R yeah the  real one a that's awesome you remembered  that's fantastic well they wrote it  right there oh phonetically which was  nice yeah we're here to recap all the  bad words fights fourth wall breaks in  the first two Deadpool movies ahead of  the third film spoilers ahead  all right so a good place to start is  actually not a Deadpool movie I think a  great place to start as X-Men Origins  Wolverine what do you think don't do it  h I'm to say it's technically the  beginning of our onscreen relationship  and yeah we don't like to talk about  this one too much no I do uh Logan deals  with uh finding love losing love uh  getting an adamantium uh no that's not  that yeah skeleton sorry adamantium  skeleton is surgically grafted to his  whole body painful  he goes on a journey of uh of Vengeance  I believe uh uh but also uh  self-discovery right and then there's  this Wade running his mouth until it's  completely sewn shut ster finally  figured out how to shut you  up well yeah that was fun was a really  smart move he had nothing to do with  well we worked together quite a bit or  for a bit at least in the movie as as  mercenaries but then Wade he gets turned  against uh uh Logan by the villain  William Striker is that who that's right  Logan kills Wade or so he thinks and he  goes on to have various adventures with  the X-Men mhm  2016 yeah it's his first Solo movie Wade  Wilson uh is a street level muscle for  higher kind of uh uh  [Music]  mercenary [ __ ] shot falls in love with  Vanessa a pro  easy uh Wade gets uh gets cancer you're  clowning you're not  clowning sense clowns people react to  news of late stage cancer differently  and is offered uh treatment in a lab uh  run by artificial an artificial mutant  named Ajax Ajax subjects way to  experiments that cure his cancer and  give him powers of regeneration and  acute reflexes but leave him seriously  disfigured did I say this was a love  story no  it's a horror  movie and I was in makeup yes yes that  was a terrible choice at the time I  realized now uh yeah wait just be one  scar yes right I like a really bad one  we can't just CGI this um so Wade  escapes he escapes the lab uh and he  goes on this like Revenge mission to  track down Ajax Now Vanessa thinks he's  dead and he doesn't want her to know how  Tu he looks for fear of rejection yeah  he's ashamed he feels a lot of Shame  he's in a highly militarized shame  spiral uh Wade then uh he crosses paths  with Colossus and negasonic teenage  Warhead one of the greatest comic book  names ever ever ever invented uh and  they're members of the X-Men uh and they  try to curb his more violent tendencies  which is you know easier said than done  and they are part of the X-Men but they  are the uh As I understood at the time  the affordable ones right and the other  affordable ones that we made we made  lots of affordable exactly yeah like  blind ow love Blind Owl Wade's  foulmouthed blind roommate and do Pinda  a friendly taxi drive I love to Pinda  too yeah exactly on paper this sounds  like a disaster actually so there's a  final battle uh where Wade Colossus and  and negasonic they team up against Ajax  uh and his right hand muscle angel dust  uh also DMX  plays Ajax takes Vanessa captive during  the fight but Wade saves the day and  gets to reunite with her yes that's said  he still uh doesn't want her to see his  face so what does he do he Staples a  picture of this guy with a lot of makeup  on to his forehead cheeks and Chin to  cover it  up yeah just Ow like a like a Band-Aid  just give it ow yeah and don't forget  the the post-credit tease show the clip  oh but I can tell you one thing and  that's a bit of a secret the sequel  we're going to have cable all right so  that brings us to Deadpool 2 oh my god  oh yeah Deadpool 2 is a family fil true  story Wade successfully won the Deadpool  suit and Monica for a few years killing  bad guys General mercenary stuff you  know yeah fails to kill one of his  targets who follows him home and then  fortunately kills Vanessa thank God I  didn't have to use the cream trees  spreader  white is destroyed and that's where I  learned fridging is and uh immediately  backtracked fridging fridging yeah you  can't just kill your love interest it's  like a terrible thing to do you got to  like yeah you got to like create proper  character arcs for everybody that's a  good point yeah the white is destroyed  yeah he is destroyed he tries to kill  himself but Colossus and negasonic save  him giving him new purpose as an X-Man  in training with training you can be  X-Men you're wasting your time shiny  Jesus I'm not X-Men material  understatement of the Year their first  mission is to take down a fire wielding  mutant named Rusty Collins but Rusty's  real name in the movie is firefist which  Deadpool finds incredibly funny way he  kills a member of Rusty's orphanage  after learning that they abused  [Music]  him what what did you do no that he was  abused you can tell you can always tell  we have rules so Wade and Rusty are  taken to a special prison how was that  well not a white collar place I'll tell  you that much were they're  forced to wear power inhibiting  collars is that right d am I reading  that right yeah power inhibiting power  dampeners inhibiting is what we call  them it took took his power away leveled  the playing field right please after  you the disgusting mutant off the  streets God Bless America good to  Taco at this time we also meet a  character named cable he's a mutant uh  whose family is actually killed by  firefist in the future uh and cable is  traveling back in time right now to kill  firefist and obviously prevent this  right he attacks five fist Rusty at the  prison but dead paol steps in to protect  him  hello  Russell firefist te teams up with  Juggernaut to bust out of this prison  Russell Russell you're okay oh thank God  my God  Juggernaut I thought that was you I  should have worn my white pants and uh  and he heads off uh down the long windy  lonely Breezy Road of villain I'm going  to rip you in half now that is such a  juggernaut thing to say wade then  assembles with xforce with Domino bedum  shadar Zeitgeist banister and Peter  wisdom to save firefist from cable but  they all die in tragic but hilarious  fashion oh God you're going to throw up  in my mask oh yeah that was a that was  sad yeah X Force dying like that yeah  who wrote this so anyway we Domino  Colossus they in neas they team up uh  again when uh firefist is about to  commit his first murder and Wade then  sacrifices himself to save firefist thus  preventing Cable's traumatic future  cable who can now only use his time  travel device one more time decides to  go back in time and save Wade even  though it means he can't return to his  family in the future no my family's safe  and I didn't do it for  you now I'm going to stick around for a  while make sure the world doesn't itself  into  oblivia oh you did it for me generous  yeah beautiful but it was also his way  of saying I'll I'll play this guy again  yeah right um and I hope he does yeah  but in the post credit sequence uh  negasonic and Yukio uh conveniently  repair ca's device allowing we to go  back in time and uh and save Vanessa I  hope you sharpened the cream cheese  spreader  come  back uh and Peter Peter X walk away this  has been pretty scary and he kills off  his own X-Men Origins character hey it's  me don't scratch cleaning up the  timelines and he also uh kills actor  Ryan Reynolds before he can sign on to  make Green Lantern and that was just a  bit of housekeeping which I made Fox pay  for a like I want to just clean up a few  akes uh do you mind if I just yeah and  they were fine with that um I need your  advice I need some cleaning up to be  done yeah clean up  to wolver and Deadpool get into de  Deadpool we wanted to call it that but  legally we couldn't Deadpool 3 or  Wolverine Wolverine 10 in Deadpool and  Wolverine Wade has uh retired basically  from uh superh heroics he's working at a  at a sort of used car dealership called  Drive Max while celebrating his birthday  the time variance Authority the TVA seen  before in Loki grabs wayer out of his  own reality and tasks him with a greater  Mission we Wilson who's  asking whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  whoa whoa whoa whoa is that supposed to  be scary the R rating isn't new for me  Fredo but it is for Disney at this point  Wade he basically decides or takes it  upon himself that he is going to find  Wolverine and he's going  to by hooker by crook get Wolverine to  help save Wade or Deadpool's reality  look lady I'm not interested all right  well I'm sort of on the tick tick so  Upsy Daisy and Emma Corin plays the  villain Cassandra NOA who is a super  powerful telepath Cassandra's  technically an alien but also kind of a  Twisted Sister of Professor Xavier not  Twisted Sister like d Snider I I get  that deep cut D Snider was in a band  called Twi Sister We're Not G to take it  okay no you only listen to John Tesh and  Yanni what is the what's on the what's  on the playlist at home you know a  little yeah oroko  Flo that's also a safe word oroko flow  how red of my ears right now right oh  God right getting small you have the  most small you have such ear I know I  break all the movie star rules you stole  them from an action figure or something  my God what are the movie star rules big  head big big big face yeah big ears yeah  I'm getting my ears done you don't hear  that often that's true getting them  plumped ultimately Deadpool and  Wolverine they got to learn how to work  together in a sort of a a I guess it  would be framed by the MCU in a way  because there's a lot we're now  officially in the MCU um on their kind  of road trip adventure this is what I'm  talking  about big slow motion action sequence  who knows if you live or  die now that should be at least I hope  that should be everything that you need  to know before seeing Deadpool on  Wolverine when it comes out July 26th um  July 26th I'm sorry if there were any um  um uh uh harsh words spoken in this  interview I'm sorry for most of what you  know Hugh does uh in general right and  um yeah go see the movie July 26th so  it's a not outro what was the actual  word I don't know it like

kind of just feel  like this movie is like the next  evolution  [Music]  hi Barbie  hi Ken we had movie church on Sunday  mornings where we could go to the  Notting Hill electric as you guys know  and see a movie that was somehow a  reference for Barbie and one of the  movies I remember after the Barbie  sleepover the movie Church movie that  next morning was his girl Friday which  had a lot to do with like the rhythm of  the dialogue yeah in terms of how they  moved and how they behaved I wanted it  to feel heightened but I didn't want it  to feel uh like a sketch where they were  you know moving around like because I  thought I was like well that will get  tiresome in about 30 seconds but I also  feel like when I we in movie Church  bridges in general like soundstage  musicals and like Oklahoma or Singing in  the Rain like there's a quality in which  the way people move it's just if they if  you saw anyone on the street looking  like a you know one of the background  dancers in Oklahoma you'd be like oh no  something's wrong but they're  they're always like in the background  like looking at a hat but it's like with  their whole bodies like it's like and I  was just like immense way sort of for  the the actors who are all wonderful  dancers as well I wanted to surround  them with dancers so actually everyone  in Barbie land is a Dancer so I didn't I  didn't have background artists  specifically they were they were all you  know they were all these wonderful  dancers so all the Barbies and Kens you  see on the beach and everywhere they  hold themselves differently than like  you know civilians  um someone said Jenny way our  choreographer said dancers  um their bodies always have a direction  and that's different than sort of normal  people so I thought that that was kind  of like in this conception of Barbie  land it's like a soundstage musical all  the Barbies and Ken's are like on we  didn't have like Barbie boot camp but I  feel like Barbie dance rehearsals became  the thing where like everybody very kind  of reached a wavelength like a very high  pitch wavelength I remember Greta  describing it as like I want it to be  the sleepover where it's like the  coolest girls and the prettiest girls  and the funniest girls but they're also  the nicest girls and that is what that  whole period felt like it was just like  very high fever pitch love for all of it  I remember the first dance rehearsal  where the rest of you girls came to join  and up until then I'd been doing a few  of them on my own which was super fun  because like the kind of dancing you  wanted was like you know how you dance  in your bedroom so it was like very fun  but then as soon as all the other  Barbies like started coming in run  rehearsal and it was like yes girl and I  was like oh my God this is this the  movie's begun now it was so fun it was  kind of like how your girlfriend's  always like amp you up if you're out  dancing it felt like that I love the  Dance Floor the dancing was so special  and also just like it was I liked that  it was just like everyone was actually  doing the dancing and it was about like  I don't know that sweetness and whenever  I need a lift I always look at they have  a video of Michael learning the dance  for the first time and it's like it's  the best video when you do this going in  a circle  this one  [Laughter]  this one part of it and he was like Alan  would know the Ken dancing  [Laughter]  Allen's dream is one day someone twists  an ankle and they're like we need a  fifth  who knows the dance  I don't remember much about this  experience  I felt like at one moment I was like a  human male in my backyard picking up a  Ken doll and then like somehow magically  had become that doll and I was being  picked up now by Greta gerway and like  the only way to become human again was  to just follow her very specific  directions  at a certain point I thought I had like  left that kid behind and I realized that  I needed his help to make this movie so  I had to go back and make peace with him  and uh ask for his help you know it was  very it was good it was good for me  thank you thank you for that getting the  whole crew to dance is like a morning  warm-up was a real Icebreaker I think it  was the entire film but Greta I remember  you saying that you felt like dancing  was such a great way to break the ice  for people because you don't have to  like look each other in the eye and come  up with conversation but you can like  move together I like to try and make eye  contact  turn  it while you dance everyone's real  relaxed can I get get really to the  bottom of something  [Music]  every day from now until forever  [Music]  do you guys ever think about dying  Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt who did the  all of the music and I had no idea how  to make a pop song I was just like I I  need a I need a pop song and um he we  started trading music a bunch and then  um we knew we wanted  like a disco song that was like the  thing and I think Dua Lipa makes like  modern tragic disco hits like that's  like her I mean when I think of her  albums and when he was like I think Duo  would be great for this and I was like  oh my God and then she came one morning  at 7am just like perfectly on time  totally ready and I was like what are  you doing today and she was like oh I'm  just performing at the O2 Arena that was  like what  um but she and we went to her concert  and we went to her concert yeah she has  that ability to like write a disco song  that's like so much fun but when you  actually listen to it you're like she's  sad you know  well this one isn't it you're like  I love disco music and disco also felt  like really related to Barbie like in  its heart because it's like so hopeful  about people which is like disco assumes  you want to dance that's not the  assumption that every musical genre  makes but disco makes it but yeah so we  knew we knew it was that song and then  we had this whole dance number which was  amazing and then the kids sadly I I feel  like you've never quite forgiven me no I  I bad mouth you and everything I know  did they really  easy you didn't give her any you just  threw her in and I was like wow she  needs the solo and I just didn't think  the president would have to dance  that was game I was coming from DC and I  got the the email that I was just to  learn a dance number that would be  performed on my first day and I was like  oh okay and I learned it with the help  of my friends who were in DC with me and  they were hyping me up much like the  dancers were hyping you up and then I  landed to a video of the dance they  changed  so then I learned it that day and it was  just in front of everyone so it was like  the first day of school and I was naked  so great thank you so much because you  cut it really well  I appreciated that I watched it and I  was like oh no in the music  in the music video The Dua Lipa actually  made she does the dance you do and it  cuts back to and I was like well see  yeah thank you for that it was she was  great my only sadness is the the sort of  you guys didn't get to be in the dance  I'm not sad  I don't  [Laughter]  dance together okay you sure have I  remember how I didn't I couldn't you tap  danced with me you did we made up a  memory no that's not true  I remember we did the whole anyway this  is real you can't tell they went to  college together we went to college  together we were actually in a play  onion  I appreciate I appreciate whenever I I'm  left out of a dance number because I  find that the worst thing that could  happen  and I did do those those were practical  my body yeah thank you yes thank you for  owning that every single person asked if  that was your leg and so the way that  you sold that you should be proud that's  my crotch 180 degrees  I did not have to do  a split and which is just as well can't  do that and so that was a fake leg and  um a heavy one yeah it was actually the  set design though it was so amazing  because they Sarah who did the set  design was like I've made all these like  like holes in the wall where hey like if  she can put her real leg in and then  we'll rig the other leg up so it was all  practical it was like done like it was  like a way a practical effect where was  your other leg in the wall in the wall  sort of like this like if this is my leg  like my other leg is here yeah yeah how  do I ask that I can't picture it and  then there was the one the one where you  could like be your whole legs are down  and then you had two fake legs on the  side  thank you for thinking of that whole  everything about it and making it so I  didn't have to obviously the sets were  sculpture and art and the costumes and  makeup and hair were like such art and  sculpture every square millimeter of  every look was like so finely considered  and there was so much philosophy and  thought behind it I remember  um Ivana who did our uh hair  which was mostly wigs it was telling me  that she had experimented a lot with  like the shape of the hair and how to  make it doll-like and that she arrived  at like it had to be thin on top and  then thicker on the bottom in order to  look doll-like and so we talked a lot  about what this sort of Barbie who had  been played with and burned and drawn on  would look like and arrived at like I  just pulled a bunch of pictures off the  internet of I think I typed in like  effed up doll  just like we sent all these pictures  back and forth and like even the  placement of like pink streaks and the  hair and like the placement of the  marker around the eye was very very  considered and thought through a Barbie  has been played with for too much is  typically naked and has lost her clothes  and so I couldn't be  nude I thought about it and then I  thought no I don't know nude and so we  we sort of sent back a lot of different  ideas and just arrived at this like wild  baby doll dress and and then you but you  one of your rules was like nothing is  dirty there's no dirt and I was like  okay yeah shoot I thought I was in like  Rags or something and you were like no  it's elevated it's a like not in doll  world and I was like  you're right every  everything they figured out but like  because we talked about like because you  were like conceived of her as like  almost like an Edward gory type doll and  then we were like well is it like Miss  havisham is it disintegrated my feeling  was about Barbie land like everything is  like Space trash like you know like  well I don't even know if this is true  like my idea is like if you threw like a  McDonald's container out into the space  it like stays pristine because there's  nothing to actually erode it is that  true I don't know  um but like did it would be like crazy  and recombined and like distorted but  not disintegrated somehow it wouldn't be  like falling apart in that way it would  never be moth eaten  um but it always had to be worked out of  like wow what is it exactly which was  fun so fun  [Music]  [Applause]  what are you doing here I'm coming with  you  [Music]  did you bring your rollerblades  I literally go nowhere without them I've  got a question for the group was there  any set because I just realized I'm like  oh yeah you didn't get to see the weird  Bob he said is there any set that anyone  was like oh I never got to be on that  set and I wanted to see it I wish  everyone had been on the transportation  sets yes  um because they were so amazing yeah oh  yeah the transportation sets were  amazing incredible it was so cool I  wanted to see the cannon Supreme Court  and and  um  talk about the transport like how did  you conceive of the transportation look  because I got to be on them and they  were amazing magic I mean and it was all  mechanical yeah like what like why why  how did you come up with that well I  wanted I mean the whole thing for the  whole movie which is what was so amazing  about working with all these artists on  it was I wanted to make everything as  much as possible always tactile and  handmade and that's why like sort of of  shooting you know Miniatures and  compositing it so it doesn't feel  synthetic it feels like it's it's real  it's there the transportation sequences  we've gone through so many different  versions of it and then I just kept  seeing like I remember as a kid building  basically that like a diorama that moved  and I put pencils and like a scrolled  piece of paper that I taped together and  then you move the pencils in the  background go and I remember being like  delighted by it and I was like this is  the best thing I've ever made I mean  essentially it was like that but bigger  the art Department sort of created kind  of with the ability to and this is where  like being able to do some version of  like previous but in favor of doing  something very in camera is really  helpful because you're like well this is  the angle of the camera this is the  speed that this thing is moving at you  can like do the math ahead of time but  yeah it was like had three planes of  movement so the back moved slowly the  mid ground moved a little faster and  then the foreground always had something  going quickly like two loops on a  treadmill so it looked like they were  moving quickly it was so fun it was so  moving getting to be there it felt like  being in a toy box like in a diorama  that a child would build and like that  idea of in this day and age where you  could just like digitize everything and  pop a screen and make everything in a  computer like the idea to approach this  movie about toys with that Spirit of  everything being something that looks  like someone made it is like it was  moving to be on those sets and it was  like your vision was so magical and I  feel like the crew was so thrilled too  it's like they were like finally flexing  these amazing muscles they have they're  like oh we can do so many things and we  get to do it on this movie whether  they're building life-size dream houses  all hand painting Mountains on a  backdrop or making with them the men who  were like puppeteering butterflies  butterflies is the bikes and there was  like a man on a ladder being like and I  was like this is my favorite thing would  you remember when we went in to see Roy  who's out stunt coordinator Roy who  takes it so seriously he was showing us  what all the stunties had come up with  for the Ken battle and it was so funny  but they were it was like he was a  military General and he was being he was  like right positions one and they're all  doing ridiculous things like giving like  CPR to a toy horse or like whatever it  is or like but and a lot of like genius  sort of Contraptions and stuff like that  like making them using them in catapults  and like all these things incredible and  we walked out of there like both like in  hysterics but also like that was so pure  how like yes how they all felt that came  together and put that together was  incredible incredible like so creative  and silly and playful at the same time  which I think is a yeah it's indicative  of this whole film being the most  creative they can be but also being like  like a silly kid at the same time  knowing they have like right their adult  smarts to give them the ability to do it  right well it's all like everybody who  works on a movie on some level is like  you know the kid who is like making  something strange on the playground or  it was like I made this or I'm doing  this and like they all got to be that  kid they're like look at what I did like  if you pull this it rigs this way like  it's all like and I feel like everyone  from like Roy to Sarah to everyone it  was like this is like the deepest part  of themselves when they made it when  there was almost like nothing to support  what they were making it just was like  them and they're like kooky idea I love  that we started with the transportation  sequence too that was our first scene  that was it was such a great  um way to start the movie because it set  the tone for  the level to which you were trying to  make every moment count you know the  love and the time that you put into  those sets and how much time do they end  up on screen  not much just like but it's also like I  I love that when it's just like oh my  God it's all this work and then it's  just the like costumes that were built  in triplicate for ours see our little  beds that were like how many fittings we  did for each of those costumes that was  just like a minute yeah the joy of  getting to wear a custom Chanel snowsuit  yeah a day  um it is it's like so much beautiful  Artistry in every frame yeah I don't  thank you enough for the opportunity to  wear a custom chanels  I remember when I saw you in it I was  like  so happy Ryan Gosling is wearing a pink  see with Chanel was that the last as  happy as I was was that the last thing  you shot was the pink snowsuit because  the first thing you shot was the boat  outfit because I remember when you  showed up we were like he's really doing  it  was like there's no way he's gonna do  this I was like I think he's gonna show  up and be like  and and then you showed up in that hat  and that pink shirt and I was like  okay and then and then the last thing we  shot was you guys almost I think on the  snow snowmobile and then you had to  record yourself screaming that's right  [Laughter]  if this got out this could be an  extremely weird things for our world  this would be  catastrophic credit didn't make it easy  when you were like you were like there's  a monologue Meryl Streep says she would  like to do this  cool no pressure  we shot it at the very I mean like the  end it felt like I was holding it for a  long time and the energy was like  building building so by the time we were  there we shot it for two days in this  house weird Barbie's house with like 12  people in the scene my experience of the  moment was that Greta gave me so much  space and so much trust and I obviously  didn't want to F it up and I wanted to  do it justice because I think you know  when I read those words it's like oh  okay truth like truth telling right and  there's no woman in my life that this  isn't true for so like how do you tell  the truth you know and that was just the  goal and you gave me so much space and  so much trust and I felt like I could go  to all the places because I had so much  trust that you would know what was right  for the movie and I felt like similar to  what you said of like I'm in Greta girl  wig's hands like I don't know and I  don't know what's happening in your head  like only Greta knows what she sees and  hears and I that was freedom to to have  so much trust in the leader of like  she'll know so I'm free to do what I  want and she'll she'll make it right  such a powerful moment such a powerful  moment in the movie and every time I've  seen it people erupt in Applause and I  have to say like it feels so true and  what's even more powerful about it is  that it feels so authentic to you  because you have had so many moments in  your career we've said the truthful  thing at the right time like your your  Ted Talk is a great example you know so  you watched my TED Talk I love your Ted  Talk oh however yeah identity identity  is your superpower  it's really powerful right right no it's  really moving and it's and it felt like  you know like somehow you had ice thanks  no one rests until this doll is back in  a box  [Music]  humans only have one ending get that  Barbie  [Music]  tears through forever America will you  do it with me yeah do you let America do  it yeah this has been entertainment  weeklies around the table with Barbie oh  with Barbie in theaters July 21st that  was perfect  [Music]",

beat up Deja  Sky  question too [ __ ] bad you fuing  pigeon [ __ ] I would Kai Kai with Corey  unfortunately and it comes out in the  picture it comes out  [Music]  hello everyone I'm Joey nuli with  Entertainment Weekly back with the cast  of rupal's Drag Race season 17  premiering January 3rd at 8:00 p.m. on  MTV and as mamao says of this very Wet n  Wild new season with a badona dunk tank  twist wetter is better and these 14 new  Queens are here to flood America's  Collective basement with tea and maybe  some tears and I I truly mean it when I  say this this cast is serving unhinged  chaos in the best way I cannot wait to  Dive Right In with the cast of rupal's  Drag Race season 17 joining me AAA  forgot arietti Crystal Envy hormona Lisa  juwel Sparkles Joella Corey  King Lana jere Lexi Love lucky  stars Lydia B Collins Ana nerve Sam star  and that's it no one  else no we have Susie back here suszie  toot now like I said I always get that  feeling before a season when I know it's  going to be a good group and this one I  feel like is going to be truly great  this is an amazing group of Queens but I  have to ask now that you have all seen  our one-on-one interviews that we did  which everybody can watch at ew.com for  free I have been reading the comments we  do need to clear up some inconsistencies  I would say maybe from certain people um  who name  arti yes in the superlatives portion um  you were unanimously voted as the  villain of the season um you immediately  called this a lie and you said that you  are and I quote very Angelic I am I'm  the nicest one here yeah what is the tea  we need to know can someone explain the  arietti experience I can't explain her  being Angelic I don't think there's for  that exactly thank you the pillow wants  to speak the pillow the pillow please  let the pillow speak I am the pillow  that talks darling and I am here to say  that I personally think arietti is the  sweetest one in the cast now for the  rest of you who said Ari Yeti girl the  angel of death honey if she's  Angelic no I love her I think all of us  were ready to make some TV and have a  good time and AR Yeti really led the  charge of making good TV and having a  good and having a good time whether or  not that's at the expense of everybody  else's good time we were there to have a  good time I think that Ari Yeti is  Angelic but AR Yeti the drag character  is definitely a villain she's like a  fierce Disney villain she might have  been the villain on camera but what  happens when the camera's off I like  that I think the arietti is just  misunderstood that's what I think like a  villain V I know that's really nice of  me I think arti is just  a I think every villain has their origin  story and season 17 is AR Yeti's villain  origin story okay long before I I think  AR is a sweetheart thank you she's baby  girl girl save it girl honestly girl  save it how much did she pay you to say  that what a congenial answer it's funny  because Lana you um said that Sam was  the drama starter of  absolutely and is and is always can we  we'll get you to elaborate and then  we'll have Sam answer for her Sam Sim  just has like these little comments  which I love I live for but Sim knows  how to pick at people and how to get  people started she does how to push  buttons and she don't answer text  messages and she doesn't reply to text  messages not answer text it's not  personal I don't text anyone back first  of all yeah you have to like FaceTime me  you have to catch me at the right time  but she'll call you a 5 am right sister  that's all you have to say sam no I was  going to say I mean I do like to press a  button or two I've never been afraid of  that and I think that just where I come  from really the pageant drag culture is  kind of shady and you kind of have to  like try to get in everyone's head  around you to make yourself feel better  you know I'm self-aware in that way so I  was definitely doing what I had to do so  you like to push buttons just not the  ones on your phone to text people back  oh  a TN twin ster twin stag gag gag as you  can already see this is what I promise  this is chaos correct um now you cannot  talk about drama without moving right  along to Corey oh my God now Cory you  told me and I quote what the did I do I  want to see the reactions to everybody  else when I tell them what your exact  quote was of the Season I'm the child of  God I'm the angel see no reaction cuz  everyone agrees thank you thank you no  we're just God smacked because that is  everything but the truth Diva I have you  know I feel like I am just I'm kind I'm  just a happy go-lucky person and I feel  as though I have just a positive outlook  on life that's a big child that's a big  friend a big kid well I was going to say  was this is this lies of Manelli lies  would all of you say that was that is  that a lie no how when when have I ever  not been kind Suzanne  well the tone you're coming at me with  right now is not helping your cas this  is they'll have to tune in on January  3rd to find out thank you I do have my  journal entries from the show if you  want me to to read some too yeah said  God said dear diary Cory King bu me  today and in my hotel room Anya I'll  move to you because Anya when I did say  did any of them get on your nerves you  were like baby when we did see the  trailer there was  [Music]  a do you have anything to add to this  conversation why does always say this  was a group of girls that didn't know  how to shut up and  clearly you can't get in a word in edge  wise so but I love it though you know  but they all have a special place in my  little nerve heart so that's very cute I  like that no cuz I what I I get the  feeling from this group that it's like  there's the the snappy moments but then  it's like you all sort sort of have a  laugh and then you're all kind of fine  at the so it's I always love to see that  but Crystal you did say just moving back  to the Corey question for a moment  Crystal you said that Corey has a huge  un moment that approaches the Eevee  versus silky fight yes so what can we  tease from that um what is it giving do  you want to know who the Eevee is the  sil versus Eevee can I even give that  info oh no no  okay it's someone you won't expect that  Cory goes at that's a that's a good  little one okay great R I went after  rule was R Cory you did very Angel else  did I do well no you very angelically  impersonated Monae exchange and which I  love yes and then Monae and Bob actually  did respond and invite you to join House  of rivalry I'm not asking anymore at  this point I'm begging Bob and Monae  please have me on sibling R I will be  there any day I I will be there I  promise girl cease and  desist so it is always interesting  though with with shows like that um you  know Pit Stop fashion photo review  sibling watch watchery it's interesting  to watch I I think the new cast sort of  acclimate to that sort of feedback on  those shows so are you all Maybe anxious  about the prospect of those reaction  shows and do you plan on like watching  those every single one I want to know  what every single person thinks of what  I do every single week it's so toxic but  it's so true I do at least you're honest  sister really honest yes honest I just I  am way too sensitive and I don't want to  look at anything and I have my boyfriend  vet out everything and just tell me  what's funny or like when people like me  so he hasn't told me much but um but I'm  waiting so I was going to say wait I  feel like there was a Monae and Bob  thing that was happening there wait we  don't have to talk about it I did hear  about that um they laughed at my face  girl she listened to my music and she  started laughing my but I will say that  was my old music and it's not my  favorite but you can stream my new music  period on Apple music Spotify and it's a  lot better and a lot more me so and if  I'm predicting correctly maybe talent  show performance as well first yes I  feel like you're going to serve  something there as well cuz I did in  doing my research on you was looking at  the live performances and like it was  giving so I mean we've got to we've got  to give it up for AAA for the first  guitar player honey the first guitar  player yes thank you she loves you thank  you now when you go on sibling rivalry  tell them that you like my song we'll do  a live reaction of the entire  album no don't do that just tell them  you like  it so I think a strength that might help  with in in this department with this  cast is I kept hearing the word meta pop  up in the one-on-one interviews that we  were doing it's one of the younger casts  I think that we have had and a lot of  you grew up as like teens and kids when  drag race was first starting which I  thought was really interesting what does  that mean that this cast is meta and how  does that change the scope of the  competition and the dynamic of the show  this year and what you're all giving I  mean it's for I'm speaking for mostly  myself but for a lot of us it's like  we're like fans of the show that have  now infiltrated the show so we're all  super self-aware as to like what's going  on and where the cameras are and  everyone is just giving the most it's  just so dramatic it's soy it's so camp  and I think it's it's a really  disgusting group of girls agree good  adjective what about you hormona what  does meta  mean like Facebook D meta is like the  most common use of it would be like yes  self-referential like you know what  you're doing and you're referencing the  fact that you know what you're doing  it's almost like breaking the fourth  wall in breaking the fourth wall sort of  situation okay yeah that makes sense mhm  all these girls do want their like viral  moment so that you know plays into that  of course and everything  so as's trying to get hers I qu myself I  said the  girls sit back there  monster do we need to hand AR a mic wait  no actually she hurt my feelings wait  wait on you're in jail like you're a  sweetheart you're misunderstood good  remember no you could retract that miss  lady go ahead have fun okay I retract it  Miss Jigglypuff shut the hell Miss  chick the girls are reading oh Jesus  wait Lana yes Lana it looks like you I  was going I was going to go back to the  question let's go back to the question I  was going to say I think it's because a  lot of us as Lydia was saying we're fans  of the show so we're going into the show  knowing what fans want from the show and  then trying to Prov that on the show and  it's just like all of us having fun with  each other creating scenes and moments  but also like loving each other because  we're aware that we're on a TV show and  we still like but the drama is real  everything drama is real but like we  also scary are like for goodful that's  what I would say is that it's not like  corny like I think there's  just  pigeon but I think I don't know I just  got this vibe that like we forgot about  the cameras in a in a good way and it  was just like Earnest fun just hanging  out and like we all genuinely became  friends and I think that also brought  out like the best parts of our  personality like all of us just kind of  hated each other and loved each other  and battled and fought and made  love wake that up honey honey  honey on that note I do want to go back  to something that lucky said in our  interviews lucky you said that the  season is going to be hot and steamy um  so were there like work room romances  and crushes going on this season girl I  think I was talking about my [ __ ] when  I said  that wait can we can I say that you can  say that girl we can hear  you um hot and steamy what I remember  that is that you know it's going to be a  really hot season there there's going to  be a lot of tension you know a lot of  hormones or  hormonas and there's going just the one  just the one and in the words of Lydia  bhul Collins you might just see some  smooching  I don't know what the all you're going  to say about that can we get subtitles  please smooching potentially okay all  right you might just see some smooching  we might see some smooching okay I'm  going to mental note of that we're going  to be watching out for that for the rest  of the season also I'm I'm curious are  there any like usually in these uh  preseason interviews like they'll give  us teases of like maybe like a  catchphrase or like something that's  going to be like recurring through the  season are there like any catchphrases  orygy  piggy piggy piggy pgy a compliment it's  a compliment not a sad joke yeah I  thought it was a  Starbuck too  good is that is that yours well Cory  Cory is so full of  catres I don't know where  tooc oh my God so we  have the gay G up so yeah there one for  every episode if it's Fierce it's Fierce  if it's Fierce it's I've counted like  nine now okay this is a group that loves  a bit and that's something that I love  about this season is that we will always  build on the joke whether we should or  not and we'll take the joke from a 1 to  a 10 every single time no matter I can  tell that yes and Anya's just going to  sit back here and silently just judge  all of you for  do well that's mother that's mother  right there well yeah you said that's  mother that was I that transitions to my  next question I mean it's it's not all  Dramatics I mean Lexi you were voted  mother of the season in the superlative  game and Anya you also received votes  for for that as well and I definitely  got that energy from both of you at  first I was surprised cuz I was like  everybody's so young this season like  mother of the season but like I get that  it's not like an age thing I get the  that it's like a maternal very warm  sisterly Auntie kind of vibe so yeah but  let's be very clear like me and Lexi  aren't old like I'm 31 how old is Lexi  29 34 34 I just think like there's a big  difference between someone in their 30s  and someone in their 20s like there's a  lot that happens in that 5 years or  whatever so I just think that like we  just had a different vibe about us  whether it be like experience until you  hit like 25 or 26 it's  like until it's not yeah this is my  impression mother doesn't it doesn't  necessarily mean they're older it just  means they have a more nurturing loving  caring I can just go to you if I need  some advice or someone to look to and  those two are the girls that's what I  meant as well with when I was saying  that like everybody thinks that that  it's like oh an age thing but it's  really not like it's it's it's a vibe  that you that you have and I I was  really delighted to see that both of you  uh got those votes um but they are older  yeah and doesn't the brain fully develop  at 25 so half this cast isn't fully  developed anyway a lot of the younger  girls are like clicky though like it was  hard for me personally to like get into  to the groups because like they had the  groups the groups were strong honey so  if anything it was just not a a thing it  was just like the younger girls they  love a click they love a clan and once  that click was clanning it was hard to  click and Clan you know what I mean I  cannot say the word hard I'm not going  to say it anymore um but there was I  felt the click energy I get what you  mean like if but that's how it's always  been I think like even at the bar that I  work at now everybody's particularly  younger than me that I hang out with so  it's just getting used to learning how  to assimilate into your guys's type of  Lifestyle like it is different than what  we grew up with the way you guys  interact like I still have friends that  are like you don't answer me enough like  about like Sam not  texting people are like you don't like  me and I'm like no I just hate to text  I'm old like it's just not my thing call  me I'm just different did did you all  you all sort of agree with that that it  was like maybe more clickish this season  I don't maybe yes for I mean for me I  didn't I try my I try my best to like  talk to everyone as much as I could I  mean from outside perspective I can see  how it could be clicky but I feel like  that girl  no but I think like the younger Queens  have like a different way of  communicating with like we talk reaction  videos and things like that it's like  easy for us to relate to that but it's  not like us trying to not talk to  anybody else like not refer that to  anybody else cuz I don't want it to seem  like it's intentional that we're like  pushing away or like separating  ourselves from I think the ones who  think that that there are no clicks are  the ones that are in the clicks maybe CL  it Joella you also had a response as  soon as I asked that question I want to  hear what what uh prompted that response  I feel like I could see both sides like  I feel like the ones that are in the  click like I don't think they like say  say my name at this  point it's I don't think they mean to  like I think it's just natural for  people to get close to each other and  like not everyone's going to get get as  close to each other as everyone so like  that's why and I just feel like the  other people they just feel left out  that's all it is that's just how people  feel it's not even a big deal it's just  you  know well to me like that's how I see  how I see I can't I'm trying lucky is  reaching for that m luy is reach I'm  sorry  sister where is the microphone I was  just going to say that wait we have to  because we can't hear luy what the  clicks what what are these clicks that y  are talking about I want to know the  click names thank you so much for your  contribution but also I will say this I  think maybe this question is best best  left played out on the season we'll see  how this how this plays out Friday to  find out there you go plug it that is  like a big part of drag race history I  mean like you know that you have the  bitter old lady Brigade and the um like  that well that was no that's that's the  ginger Ming and the Heathers and boogers  the bitter old lady Brigade like there  are like well-known clicks of drag race  history that's not I wasn't talking  about the  season Lexi you already brought this up  that we were getting to in the  one-on-one interviews miss miss suie you  were my first interview of the day and  you um said that you are unequivocally  the runway Queen of the  Season everyone on the cast would agree  how would everybody described sus as the  best Runway looks apparently of the  season because La Roach said away from  Cory King keep that mic away from her to  fing bad youing pigeon [ __ ]  you bird I have no idea apparently I was  raring these sunglasses the entire  season because I had no clue why but I  still loved her to death as a human  being and that's why I'm still a fan of  I'm not going to say your name out of  drag but him I love him  I love him but I hate  Susie I think Susie just has a really  different perspective of drag so you're  really going to get some interesting  unique different never seen before she  is so referential she is so smart so  funny I agree no she's the girls who get  it will get it and the girls who don't  we wear a body suit Sam would like to I  think a lot of us are just inspired by  like you know more modern things and  Susie like this is not a read I know I'm  just saying she likes that sort of  old old Maiden type of drag old Maiden  type of  drag but what I'm saying is I love Susie  and I love how smart she is and the  references are genius I mean don't let  them hate on you can I say when when we  started our relationship I was that girl  I will say today in front of everybody  and Joey noi look at her today this this  is a fashion girl e she is she gets that  credit now  yes the bread baby get the bread just  remember this when you're watching the  season what I will say Joey noi if if  there's one thing I know better than  fashion which I know a lot about it's  how to keep the conversation about me go  yes yes I will say cuz then I asked I  told you every single girl I was like  Susie said she's the runway Queen of the  season everybody was like yeah so no  that was I will say honestly from your  Instagram I was I was gagged by the  runways that you brought it was very  sickening so I will and her perspective  is just so different and the way that  she's able to polish like camp and like  drag is like very it's like now what do  you have to say about my Instagram  before girl shuck it in the  bucket you had three photos and there  that one that like you bite like this  the Twizzler one the twiz  one it haunts me I like the coin corset  dress one that one  cut the  is I personally I liked all of su  runways honestly I really did I wouldn't  wear them but I like them arietti you  also won uh most fashionable of the  season when I asked everybody so um I  would love to hear more about like just  overall in general what you think um and  we'll start with you arietti what the  season is serving in terms of Runway and  extravagance on the runway honestly the  runway category surprised me  everyone did actually really good and  I'm going to say actually actually  actually she's being sincere that she's  being sincere she's using a different  tone very register she's being  sincere very kind this is a sincere  register no honestly everyone brought  their aame when it comes to looks and  I'm very proud of everyone and I can't  wait for everyone to see so we knew you  were an  angel you're incredible I think that's  the first compliment we've ever received  from  as a group and that's the only one you  get I'll take it though I'll take it  I'll take it well let's hear I want to  hear from everybody about like just the  takes on the runway like what if anybody  oh L  lucky can I just say my take on the  runway I honestly wanted to can y'all  stop laughing at  me I'm just a pillow trying to talk of  course pillow um I'm trying to pillow  talk baby I would say that in my case I  can't speak for everybody but I  preparing for drag race I wanted to kind  of give campy Club kid that like I would  have never seen before no matter if you  like it or not it's always going to be  extra it was always going to be colorful  it was always going to be very Whimsical  so that's all I can say about  myself okay period I will say for me I  never had the opportunity to like wear  actual garments before because when I'm  performing in New York I'm literally  wearing like braw and panties and  bodysuits from Fashion Nova so now that  I have the opportunity to like do and  live out my modeling dream it's like  going to be Fab and it was yeah it was  Lydia my my spooky Queen I asked you if  you pushed any maybe horror limits on  the runway and you said that you push  limits for profane imagery on the runway  um so can you tease a little bit more  about what what what are some mood words  that we can expect from that I think a  lot of the girlies are pretty profane  and we some pretty um scandalous things  but I feel like I mean unless it if it  looks how it looks I feel like there's  no way they can like cut around it and  make it look um presentable for like yes  yes she's just going to be a blurred out  BL let's just say the competition was  stiff but I was a little  stiffer okay that's the P I was looking  for yes speaking of the trailer um we  we're getting some really great guest  judges um Joella i i as soon as I saw  the trailer I immediately thought of you  because of what we talked about with  your name with Katy Perry and I was oh  my gosh like there's it it was just love  King should we not go here let's take it  there okay let's go there and then pray  for her the mic is all yours you that  you had like that she recognized you  from like events that you had gone to so  I was just wondering if like that  connection like when she saw you on the  runway there was like a connection and  you recognized each other and it was  what kind of see when we tune in on MTV  on January 3rd when we make a splash on  MTV  and you will see for yourself if she  recognizes me or not promise I  scandalous  scandalous Clocky Clocky clock  it don't  forget there was there was a lot of  really good guest judges in the trailer  though like the law La Roach I know like  everybody has been saying that they want  to see La Roach back as a judge so like  and he looks like he was really like  giving it to the girls so like how what  was he like as a as a guest traumatizing  traumatizing traing he's terrifying I  thought he was nice honestly I loved La  Rose honestly like one of the sweetest  most genuine people I've ever met and  had the privilege of talking to honestly  like so inspiring so beautiful a  sweetheart truly I have never been more  like honored to be told I looked  terrible by someone in my life and I was  like I will do better so literally law  I'm trying Look at me now Look at the  material I think it's so it's so  exciting cuz law roach is a guest judge  that like the fans always have a huge  reaction to and to have a judge that's  present that lifts the stakes of a  challenge is such a it makes her such a  great episode for great TV so that's so  exciting to have him there not for our  feelings but for your fans for you  agreen for the people yes all this is  for you they will laugh and smile at our  demise well I do want to move on to the  bedona dunk tank twist which I thought  was so fun uh what what does Michelle  look like going into the water  amazing like a  siren yeah she looks like a Jersey Shore  siren it's very that yes girl [ __ ] our  runways every single week she comes out  in a different bathing suit serving so  much every  ohelle Michelle don't watch for us watch  to see what bathing shoes she wears  every single  week  too ank she always has an  ank the leg the leg  she would have toe rings on and ankle  bracelets on it look such a weird thing  to stare at but her feet were just so  beautiful she was just a little every  time yes Nina don't  Hur who would have know that that was  the question that everybody like jumping  and on we love Michelle we do love Mich  yes no it does look like a really fun  twist do how do you think does that I  mean obviously like elimination is a sad  thing on this show but like that had to  have added like an element of fun I  guess to The Dread of you know Jud day  it worse worse it made it worse wor I  thought it was F you're going to have to  tune in  MTV that's the goto like can't say we  make a splash do we make a  SP in the bka tank we also have the  return of Raa queen  and I mean that I think I already have  my answer you know things got pretty  Savage on Season 16 with plain Jane  sabotaging voting uh so did did things  also get chaotic with the voting this  year no  girl well not on the same scale there  was no roris no roris at all there was  definitely some choices and some opinion  on the same scale not on the same scale  like I said I'm very sensitive so I care  a lot about what everyone thinks of me  so it's like really intimidating and  scary to have it all out there on the  table there's a lot of differing  opinions as to what good drag is I guess  right yeah um I will say that there is a  scandal involved in the RA in the ra  Queen process I cannot tell you who with  whom with what someone with a very very  very wrong opinion I well Cory you do  come from the drag family that pioneered  sabotaging the ra Queen uh voting I am  different I voted very fairly I think I  think it was very congenial and very  fair and very  kind very godline I would never AR and  Joella both like looked away and we like  well she's the villain so we can't trust  her no I'm the one you can trust that's  the thing  evil that's what they love saying I keep  it real I was so nice and so kind to  unrated Queen child god of the  sey after the resurrection what was that  what did she say I said she's the child  of God after the  resurrection AR you you keep lifting the  mic what are you going to say oh I'm  playing with it I'm doing this  okay okay what I will say about ra Queen  is that I think it was such a good  choice and I loved it yes I think it  definitely gave people their moment yeah  oh it definitely gave them a moment it  raises the stakes when you're judged by  your peers and not the judges right yes  and so so Anya and Sam I think you're  the only two we have not heard from on I  just don't like ra Queen whatever I just  don't like being judged by people who  I'm in the same competition with and I  don't think we're like qualified to  judge each other so if we're in a  competition of being judged I want to be  judged by the judges not my  competitors oh lucky yes lucky sorry  sorry sorry sorry I couldn't hear I  couldn't hear you from the pillow okay  so I will say this piggybacking off of  what Anya said uh I shout out to the  piggies I honestly I went into drag race  to be judged by RuPaul and the judges so  not to say that I don't value the you  know the Judgment of my peers but but I  definitely would rather be judged by the  judges in the  drama we're going to yeah I want  everybody to answer on this question so  just jump in  it'ss right if it's fears it's fears and  I was going to say okay when you do get  raided by these Queens like we are all  harsh critics so I feel like what  because of the raid Queen we're all like  oh we got to really like not only give  it all cuz the judges can give nice  critiques to everybody no we get one  good critique and then the rest is down  I was going to say I know before I was  really nervous because you don't know if  the girls are going to rate fairly if  French e a man a Man Too Much Dunkin'  Donuts this early sorry I'm going it's  all right you just don't know if they're  going to rate you fairly um so it made  the pressure even worse I think but I  think it all turned out fine we'll see  like she said there is some controversy  involved you have to tune in January 3rd  this is good te this is all good teases  these are all good teases yeah  I literally hated it terrified of it but  I really wanted to do it because I was  desperate to know what you guys thought  about my drag so even though I don't  want your judgment and I am only there  for the judges I was absolutely  desperate to know like where you guys  like just pegged me unless you wanted to  actually Peg me we haven't you all have  penises there's no  here wa hormona I don't think you you've  spoken on  this so how what feel about raid Queen  is I feel like everybody like judge  fairly honestly not that I really you  know one of their opinions of myself but  I think that everybody judged like  fairly okay I did I  know I think they judged fairly we'd  like to hope so tune in who knows tune  in January 3rd  on did we just fa saying Jo opinions I  want to switch gears just a little bit  because I know the show it's it's as  this interview has proved it's fun it's  Community it's drama it's spectacle it's  all the things and I think this is proof  that this interview that we just did is  why this season is going to be so good I  do want to get serious for a moment  because we are heading into a scary time  frankly I think for this community and  the show premieres 3 weeks before a  presidential switch that has a lot of  people in the community scared it's a  difficult time we've talked to a lot of  drag queens in the past about this  there's the drag defense fund um rup  Paul made a video about all of this I  mean this a scary time and I want to  know what advice you all have for people  heading into uncertain times this year  who are going to be looking to this show  in particular to be a sort of Guiding  Light in these times uh for me now is  more of a time than ever to be a  community and to lean on one another and  to make sure that we are like being  vocal about what's going on as well as  just being there for each other because  we have to endure the next four years  we'll get through it as we you know we  do in the past but we have to make sure  that we hold each other's hands we  uplift one another another we are  supporting each other and being kind and  loving one another more than ever now  and just uplift your peers then make  sure you're uplifting any small  marginalized groups black Trans PC  people Everyone that you possibly can  throughout all of history through dark  times and through like scary scary scary  [ __ ] that is when art is most vital and  most spread and the most incredible art  that exists in the world is because of  tragedy and and fighting and and  survival supporting art is more  important than ever making art is more  important than ever art that is real and  gritty and [ __ ] that is the whole point  yes and also there are three Florida  Queens this season which is something  like we all were working drag queens  when stuff was shutting down and stuff  was getting bars that or most of my  income was not going to exist or be able  to do shows the same way anymore is real  and so I'm so glad that the three of us  our voices get to be heard and our art  gets to be shown this season I was going  to say I know for myself growing up in  the conservative South in Alabama drag  was such escapism for me and I'm hoping  that the show airing at this time can be  escapism for everyone and you know we're  all in this together and like crystal  said we'll make it through so stay  strong hormona did you want to say um I  feel like every I'll call it a villain  in history whether that be fiction or  nonfiction uses a primary weapon and  that's a weapon of isolation and I think  that as queer people it's in our DNA to  sort of suffer in silence sometimes um  so I think now is a good time for us to  lean on one another it's also a good  time for the queer Community itself to  start to deconstruct some of the biases  that's within it people don't want to  talk about it but there's a lot of bias  towards trans people towards people of  color that's in the queer community and  I think that people don't talk about  that enough and the only way you can  deconstruct those biases if you  acknowled that you have them so I think  that that's a time for something we  should start doing more of too to that  absolutely absolutely yes yes  s Lexi it's not going to be like a walk  in the park we all know that and we are  only going to be here for the next year  for everybody so we will be your 14  weapons and the only other one you need  is love okay we've got your back and  then season 18 we'll have your back and  then we'll just carry on baby and I  think like it's been a Common Thread  that this is like the season of  Sisterhood and everyone is like close  and friends and I think that is the  energy that we're going into this new  presidency with none of us are like  fighting or feuding or creating tension  in the community at least for our 14  person community and that's the energy  we're bringing to this country I think  it's so important to not lose hope you  know like it's going to be a scary time  but you know queer people have always  fought their way through things and this  is no different we're going to keep  fighting and keeping Fierce and string  with one foot in front of the other CL  some of us some of us of us some of us  will simply walk you know I will say I  will never lose hope as long as I get to  look at lucky stars in this outfit so I  mean let prot yes queer art worth  protection so I do want to end on um a  fun note from uh past contestants I had  some past contestants submit questions  for all of you so we have a few first  Best Buy icon and season 15 Queen Robin  Fierce who also says congratulations to  you all by the way and she she thank you  she said that she cannot wait to watch  you on this season she wants to play

knew I need oh my  [Music]  God I'm Christen chenwick I'm arianaa  Grande I'm CA I'm Adena men how did you  all kind of arrive at what your cameo  and your role in the film would be  Steven Schwarz yeah wrote it they just  asked us and I said just make us look  pretty what was the original we both  text and and she said have you seen the  description of us in the movie and it  was like it didn't say old DE  cpid said something like that but then  it said then we changed it and we said  no we're not going to be those way go  there can't we just be beautiful fairy  goddesses godd goddesses we might have  had that one heart Chang just that one  and fabulous you needed it fantastic it  we insisted we were like this is not  happening without there yes so where is  it and we had the best day rehearsing we  sure did it was almost like Glendon  Alaba grew up you  know it was so fun it was fun you do  your vocal riff which I love was that  part of the script or did you throw that  in there of course she threw it in there  didn't that's like so oh Steven wrote  that  in no we just showed up right yeah it  was Steven Schwarz yeah figured out how  to put all the singing into one key and  arrange it  yeah you really put your own stamp on  the end of divine gravity were there a  lot of conversations around that Steven  Schwarz was in the uh whilst we were  doing the comps for the rehearsal um  tracks he said he trusted me with the  story I did it by the book first and he  was like  and trust you with the story so what's  your what's your war cry I tried a  couple things and then I did the one  that I that stuck cuz it felt good felt  right and that's the one that stuck it's  so good thank you it is so good it is  [Music]  [Applause]  good I read the wicked novel by bra mger  um so I had a lot of dot to draw from um  although the novel is much darker and  different than the show but I watched  Margaret Hamilton a lot and hoped that  it would just kind of  infused and I think the time where it  connected for me was in her cackle and  finding that in our scenes and stuff  like that Margaret Hamilton was  definitely like a a touchstone for me  but looking at the image of her I always  go back to this image of you know like  the black and white where she's got her  CLA things at it's the first time I  realized she has na mhm that's something  I can can pull in the look of her as  well but then i' obviously seen the show  a couple times and I had listened to  both of you often so I had your voices  in my head and I had her sort of imagery  so it's really nice to sort of find  pieces of those things to create  something and then add my own thing to  it you sure did thank you yes you did  yeah thank you you both did the original  Broadway cast recording was of course my  lifeline growing up it was always  something that brought me great comfort  and happiness and I would listen to it  when I was nervous for something or sad  about something and it was always a safe  space for me I also read The Original El  Frank bom books and there are so many  there's so many insane characters that  like we just haven't even touched upon  yeah I know it's really incredible every  single person our props Department our  costume designer Paul our our set  designer Ethan Crowley every single  thing was a piece of azian history from  the books and what's been before us The  Wizard of Oz and wicked you're Wicked  want to wear try them on I mean  including my glasses I brought today oh  yeah  those wonderful I remember when we got  the news FaceTiming you and both of us  just being soing sobbing snotty Dolphins  I was like who can speak higher still  got we couldn't hear word there's white  noise and P not it's not glitter SN it's  not glitter I think you face we did yeah  we sunny and beautiful and like you're  and blue it like the sun was on you yeah  yeah you're so sweet think she was so um  so she was so respectful thank you  brother yeah thank you I felt very very  supported by both of you actually I felt  really really sported um and like given  the room and space and just like lots of  encouragement after you seeing the film  that voice note I still play it  sometimes oh saved mine too I saved the  voice and I played them I play  I meant it I know I think it meant a  lot why are you K ter I just I meant it  I don't know I saw very emotional and I  just felt like you both did such Justice  yes to the story um it  good you just it's a beautiful tribute  not to make it about us in any way but  it's just you found your own  light G it's gone the glasses on how did  we get here we  started I knew i' need be I know I  should have brought mine too oh  [Music]  [Applause]  no I was uh called into just sing for  the alphabet I was given and I define  gravity and for good to sing just those  little D just tiny tiny songs mine was a  a camera test so my audition was like 3  hours so I sang those songs but did the  scenes and the scene work and for good  how close was the Caren because I find  that doing musicals unfilm is very  tricky because what it takes for us to  sing for real makes really  ugly like conss and so sometimes you  have to sing for get that all the time  if the mouth has to be open the mouth  has to be open you know it's real cuz  you have to see the things but sometimes  I say like I say the is this horrible  singing yeah back back up before this  publicly we had only ever sung the  opposite songs I had only ever sung the  Wizard and I and she had only over sung  thank goodness that's right I had no  idea M mhm did you know that there no I  remember you doing she did it at the I  remember than 15th anniversary with her  lips and everything that was crazy not  crazy it was amazing it was amazing but  I'm so glad you sang thank goodness was  my favorite song I loved it that's my  favorite song Don't tell any  you know it is I do know I mean I love  all the alphabet song of course but you  know when you're doing it h hour a week  you to love yes and I always just love  that you always said that and I love I'm  not that girl  oh what her I'm not that girl is my  favorite did they did they test you to  see if you could hit that I'm not that  girl no they just made me do it in front  of a live audience after she leaves you  know I have like two two verses of it  like while the set changed so I could  hear clunk clunk clunk in the background  and I was like I'm not  that I'm not that it was fine it was  just fine it was prayer fith good the  show for me has always held the three uh  themes I look for in any piece really  which is friendship love you know and  and forgiveness which is hard to do with  people that you have the most that's  what it's all it's all in there it's all  and the tapestry of this piece even  though there's a love story with a man  what we love is the true love stories  between the wom women and The Sisterhood  and I was cast it was very much a side  character and then it kind of developed  into this love story between the two  women it wasn't always meant to be that  I think were you ever surprised by that  I mean at first I kind of was I was like  wow it's turning into it's evolving into  that I think I was too self-absorbed and  worrying about yeah if I was going to be  fired all the time said um I was just so  happy to have someone that was always  there to say to see me and to support me  I remember we opened San Francisco and  we were still very much working on the  show and I think it's okay and fair to  say that we weren't there yet I remember  at intermission after she defies gravity  I went to adena's dressing room and I  said it nothing's going to matter what  anyone says because did you hear I  remember I remember that that's so  beautiful it's not the truth it is the  truth they went crazy when you flew and  when you defied gravity they yes they do  crazy when she sings popular and so  she's she's being nice or when she comes  down in the bubble from right in what  are you saying it's just funny cuz this  is what we do this is what we do really  yeah I mean honestly she says the whole  the whole audience just explodes when  she comes out in the bubble even though  she was afraid that she was eating um  soap suds I thought for sure I was going  to get cancer and it's spr go well the  bubble juice you know the bubble bubble  juice it's okay but we both did our part  and I just remember well you know I ate  so much of it that's one thing they got  to do in the movie which she got to have  a real bubble and I was so happy about  that I mean I loved our bubble but you  know and you know you really fly and I  love your flying but you know you get to  do things in a movie that we do  differently and a play it's nice to see  in the film I'm so glad that we're still  alive to see me too me too you all share  a legacy in culture with these  characters and you are kind of the only  for to have this this special Legacy  here together across time how does that  feel and what do you hope that Legacy is  going forward I think it's a good show  when we're older we could do  Vegas we swi be you'll be D I'll be D  I'll be  F I want to switch with can we please  switch just one time been working out no  I'm sorry I didn't mean a joke I think  the Legacy theirs doesn't stop because  that show is still going you know there  are still young women who want to be on  the stage and who want to be in that  theater to watch the girls that can't  get to the theater and can't get on the  stage can watch it from their homes or  watch it from a a cinema go with their  parents and so actually what this means  now is that more people can see more  people can share in it more people can  learn that difference is something to be  celebrated more people can learn that  you can forgive more people can learn  that you can love more people can learn  about friendship and goats and goats and  love and speaking and speaking speaking  their peace and their mind and what's on  their heart without and feeling safe  what I love so much about it is  especially in this time that we're  living in  that women can be really powerful yeah  and Unapologetic about it and more  beautiful because they speak their mind  and they're ferocious and Powerful I  love that that's  celebrated  holy the Legacy just continues that's a  big word but it will continue with this  movie it with our show Once in a  Lifetime Legacy yeah thank you for  watching everybody we know that when you  see this movie you too will be changed  for good yes Jesus  snap perfect",

      "page_content": "what have you learn about each other  through this experience Nothing At  [Music]  All In fact when SE I did a play last  year and when Sebastian came to see it I  felt like I was meeting him really for  the first time the circumstances the  timing of the shoot and everything just  didn't allow for anything outside of it  and and I think in a way that was really  beneficial Roy con nice to meet you do  Roy con from all the papers yeah you're  brutal guilty is  charged the feeling of sort of having  our feet to the fire was definitely part  of this which just made us I think work  harder and and take the responsibility  you can't go into this without at least  in my case thinking that um everyone and  their cousin and their dentist and their  neighbor is going to have an opinion  about this particular person um but at  some point you just have to not really  care about that it didn't enter into my  mind all that much except that I knew  that we would be sort of touching the  third rail in making this movie but in a  way that's a goal the goal is to make  work that touches the third rail what  felt at stake here was was important  enough and and the chance to work with  Jeremy and Ali exceeded that and so that  was um that over powerered everything  else for me I think Gabe Sherman who  wrote it is a very well-regarded  journalist and he researched this  exhaustively and meticulously so the  level of journalistic and historical  veracity is really there and then Ali  brings a kind of punk rock David Lynch  ride to it I didn't always win there's  rules the first rule is Attack Attack  Attack Ru two admit nothing deny  everything  three no matter what happens you claim  victory and never admit defeat obviously  we were trying to find the right balance  of prostetics I think we were both kind  of wanting less as more approach on this  the essence was more important than the  likeness these are such familiar people  you know it has to go beyond just  something mimetic you can't just be  doing an imitation you know this film is  taking these two individuals seriously  but it's a painting not a photograph one  of my favorite things um was what you  said actually at the very beginning  which was I'm playing a guy named Roy  and you're playing a guy named Donald  it's a relationship it's it's uh fian  and Shakespearean in ways in some ways  it's sort of a love story there's a  mentorship to it this is not a political  movie it's a movie about the  relationship between these two Outsiders  who became the ultimate insiders using  Roy con's Playbook of always attack deny  everything and never admit defeat he's  one of the most uh influential figures  in the 20th century it turns out his  sort of long Shadow being cast to to  where we are today in the darkness uh  [Music]  today I record everything in case I need  it well that's illegal you have to be  willing to do anything to anyone to win  it was very exciting to have a you know  to just kind of be in the ring with each  other and know that whatever we were  going to throw at each other the other  would punch back above their weight you  got to work on that your face look like  an orange Maria was lovely I mean very  committed very open I think to to sort  of the way we were shooting and  obviously uh she's from that part of the  world Eastern Europe and and I think  there's a lot of authenticity and  familiarity that she had with Ivana that  sort of maybe somebody else wouldn't  have and Roy con was someone who  believed that law was an adversarial  profession he was a pretty aggressive  person and he also believed in what he  called owning the surprise as I do as an  actor so I would pounce on her in scenes  and she was fantastic to work with  honestly for me the joy of of uh going a  set it's just not knowing what what was  going to happen even take to take I feel  like every day was pretty pretty  difficult locations and timing and the  nature of how we were shooting which was  very off-kilter but then you had all  these beautiful moments come out of it  that we didn't anticipate I was talking  to Ellie on the phone yesterday and he  reminded me that our very first day of  filming was in a helicopter you have to  commit to what you're doing and until  you cross that Rubicon there's a certain  measure of dread and uncertainty and the  feeling of is this going to work that  compounded with the fact that we were  like up in the air precariously in a  helicopter being buffeted around by the  wind was a fitting first day neither of  us are really great Flyers but as Donald  and Roy there was no there was no nerves  those first initial takes of just  committing to what we were doing  accepting each other and improvising the  hell out of everything was a  exhilarating way to start this roller  coaster ride  spectacular Hotel absolutely spectacular  and uh that sounds very ambitious where  to get the drive still so young Donal I  got I got flare and I'm smart so I I  think that's going to make me successful  but but I also want to stay humble I  think we're both actors who look  for chances to take risks chances to do  something transformational and embrace  walking the plank this is a big plank to  walk I think we relished it and and you  know took it very seriously I think we  have to nurture empathy and that's at  stake now more than ever it feels like  and the only way to do that is sometimes  to to confront it with with its opposite  and we have to be aware of the things in  the dark as much as we are of the things  in the light it's a movie about the  making of Donald Trump which is in my  feeling sort of imperative and mandatory  viewing for anyone in this country  affected by his leadership which is  everyone you know this relationship with  Roy con and what Roy taught him it's a  story that people really don't know it's  a movie about the birth of his worldview  his moral  philosophical and ethical framework I  think we're spending a lot of time  reading a lot of things on on the  internet and looking to be told how to  feel to think I hope that that hopefully  this this movie leads people towards a  reconnection with their own Humanity in  away and getting some level of  understanding out of it if you are prot  Trump if you're anti-trump it's not  telling you how to vote as Ali  said if you liked Barbie this movie is  for you if you didn't like Barbie this  movie is for you  [Music]",

entrance I mean  this is my debut I thought I was  entering the world's largest pageant  little did I know there were no score  sheets no categories and I was a lovely  runner up but on that day I remember  strutting into the workroom making my  debut and I was live loud and lit this  is the beginning of Alyssa Edwards girl  I am gagging I have this gold cage look  on I'm waving to everybody and nobody  but in my world I was on the Miss  Universe stage it was fabulous it was  fun it was Camp it was glamour my hair  was Texas SI huge I had a little  fascinator I had no clue who was going  to be in that work room and I don't  think I was worried nor interested  because in my world it's all about me  and everyone's just a visitor I remember  being backstage not knowing what to  expect but I was all prayed up and  prepared to expect the unexpected and  that indeed it was as I was dropped into  a 30ft water tank for a photo shoot I  look like a drowned rat I remember  watching season 5 at my good  girlfriend's house Michelli and when I  looked over and told Coco montrice girl  look how orange you look I had no words  well I look over to my left cuz I  noticed that there's a mirror and I need  to check you know a gal out and I see  Coco mon the face crack of the Century  Girl look how orange you look girl now  if you all don't know the story and the  history behind me and Coco monce I want  you to Google Alysa Edwards Miss gay  America 2010 I was a lovely Miss gay  America for one month before that lady  snatched that Tiara off my head but the  wig did not move she's unshakable I was  on that television show acting a plum  fool who doesn't love a good friend of  me Duo the two Miss Americas battling  out Head to Head here's the thing me and  coko are like sisters from another  mister we squabble we bicker we fight  but we always make up  oh my God y'all really going to do this  to me today the unforgettable cuz I  don't know if it was iconic or legendary  snatched game moment of season five  she's my Teenage Dream hey Katie Perry  truth be told here's a fun fact I'm will  keep it real with y'all today when  RuPaul said we were doing the snatch  game y'all didn't know I packed the  secret weapon I had the blue wig the  Katy Perry wig in my purse I thought the  Katy Perry was spot on and then when R  called me in the bottom I was just  convinced that she just wanted to see me  lip syn again then I had to apologize  now that was the iconic part when I  tweeted Katie Perry on a rology and then  all the kitty cat fans came and  celebrated I think even Katie liked the  post we all giggled about it and that's  the beauty of drag I mean if you can't  laugh at yourself how in the hell is an  audience going to laugh with you or at  you in my case Katie I did watch your  documentary three times in the movie  theaters in fact I took my entire beyond  belief Dance Company on a field trip but  girl I cannot watch that snatch game cuz  it was all wrong hi R did you really  kiss a  girl have you ever kissed a girl oh R  never but just know it comes from a  place of love what can you expect from  my snatch game character on global All  Stars stay  tuned rup Paul says category is it's a  roast and I am ready to roast and toast  these gals but I think in the end I  roasted and toasted my damn self I had  fun doing it no one's safe at a roast  chickens I mean it's no Elissa secret  that I my biggest fan and I say that  everywhere I go because facts are facts  but I think I was burnt crisp in that  category I thought I had auditioned for  rot Paul's  next drag queen of the year in the  bottom  again and I let that Santino Rice have  it in fact we need to do a wellness  checkup does anybody know where Santino  rice is these days cuz I know I'm  looking fabulous here today on this good  day Santina if you're watching this I  hope you join the rest of the world and  watch me represent the global all star  and I make you proud when I do my roast  I learned I took notes I think I used  every bit of material I had wrote in my  little journal for the roast and they  all flatlined but to me it was hilarious  I was the star and I was the audience in  my own show I let Santino Rice have  it this is my very first mini challenge  the drama queens I mean I should be good  at this right The Crying Game oh no  where you need to cry on Q actually I  was good at this we're all sitting in a  circle like we're the uh First Wives  Club in a therapy session mhm and I am a  southern housewife before the housewives  you know what they are today see I was  the leader of the pack Paving the way  for all the gals to come through  afterwards I was giving y'all drama and  tears a little shaking go wig some  eyeliner I was good but I'll be damned I  wasn't good enough to win that's all  right winning isn't everything but  wanting to is here I am lipsyncing for  my life up against Coco monre the time  has come we your lip syn for your life  that lip syn was lit because the two  Frenemies the sisters going went at it  the battle for the final Crown in the  end Coco montrice was victorious she  packed me right on back to mosquite  don't think I prepared for that but you  know what I've learned my granny taught  me at a very young age sometimes in life  you got to make lemonade out of lemons  and I did exactly that when I got back  to my house of course I went to go teach  my dance classes but I found the joy in  my season 5 experience that was the  birth of Alyssa's secret and here I was  all the way a little gay boy from  mosquite in Hollywood never imagined nor  dreamt of this but I was prepared for  what the future had in  store oh but y'all want a plot twist  y'all thought y'all had seen the best  and the worst and the last to me well  think again cuz here she goes strutting  back into the work room for All Star to  and I done turn the back rolls into bank  rolls when I got the call to be on All  Stars 2 I was in the airport I think in  North Carolina and I knew this was it  sometimes in life you don't get a second  chance and I've learned and I had groom  and I was ready I struck back into that  work room I mean look at me I did not  ask any of my sisters from season 5 if  they were going to be on All Stars 2 cuz  I was just worried about me and I got  myself together I packed my good bags my  good things I jumped on a plane I landed  in Hollywood yet again but I was ready  this go around  the category is drag movie  [Music]  sequels L sing this  [Music]  song oh my gosh do dud I'm paired up  with Alaska we are doing whatever  happened to Baby Jane whatever happened  to Alysa get the do all the do DOS who  cares it was funny it's drag me and  Alaska might not have won that challenge  but truth be told I think we were the  most memorable for all you viewers at  home do y'all remember the doall doll  action Camp Town L sing this  song it's dudah dudah dudah correct you  just have to say dudah  doah I think Michelle had to tell me do  do do whatever line it was I can't even  remember about 10 times I was committed  to the character but damn I could not  get that script solid now here's the  thing as God as my witness here on this  good day in this lovely lighting and in  my good mermaid dress that camera dress  is so draggy and so campy and so fun and  you want to know my inspiration behind  that if you ever seen the movie The  Goonies when the character opens up the  trench coat has all these gadgets and  gizmos that's exactly what I was going  for nobody got the reference and  Michelle definitely didn't like it but I  loved it and I had fun wearing it and  that's all that matters this dress is  actually worn in the Michael Jackson cir  show take that and Rewind it back and  then we're pulling lipsticks and my  season five sister good Alaska pulls out  my lipstick I was gagged surprised not  really I would have voted me out  too just when the girls thought that  they had voted me off the island on All  Star 2 little did they know I would be  given an opportunity to get back in the  competition you all got to admit that  mirror scene un forgettable I remember  the day that I got voted off the island  and the work room I'm walking off I  think well girl that's it they got you  gal get your stuff get back to the house  and go on back to the beyond belief  Dance Company teach a good old Jazz  class and keep it moving like you always  have and I'm walking back there I grab  my little rul doll and I grab my little  rul statue I mean I'm giving the only  acceptance speech and the next thing I  know girl she heres I look over I  thought it was a malfunction it was a RL  letting me know that I have an  opportunity to get back in the  competition and I just knew this was my  moment I knew RuPaul wanted me to win  and just when I thought I was going back  on stage I'm being ushered behind the  mirror you all remember this the mirror  scene I get put behind that mirror and  I'm thinking well what is this but fun  fact as I'm rounding the corner I'm just  getting my hair ready I'm giggling I'm  like the girls are going to be cracked  when I come around this corner and then  as I round the corner I see Coco mon  trees Tatiana and ginger M I look at and  I say to them what are you all doing  here they saidwell Alyssa the same thing  you are oh no I'm coming back to the  competition they said so are we I said  oh I didn't leave they said neither did  we and the next thing I know the girls  come walking in the  workroom those mirrors come on and I  look like the real Mommy  Dearest and I got to come back to the  competition for one day I heard the  girls I think they were given a few  monologues I loved what Jinx Monsoon  said in season 5 water off a duck's back  water off a queen's back roll keep it  moving keep it  moving there's a catch to me coming back  to the competition I am paired up with  Alaska and we're going to be given a  comedy set and the winning team the one  in the bottom gets to come back oh my  gosh what a roller coaster me and Alaska  up there on stage bantering back and  forth me calling Michelle a beast  describe Michelle V in one word Beast I  didn't realize how silly I looked until  I said it my good girlfriend Shell's  house again Good Old Miss Shell and I  looked over and asked her girl do I  really act like that in real life she  said Justin you are my very best friend  each and every day this is you I got to  come back though cuz I won so I'll take  it and sometimes in life you got to take  it where you can get it I got to come  back for one day and then I got it  because my other season 5 sister sent me  home again I was in the bottom twice and  got sent home twice the math ain't  mathing but guess what I'm a working  lady and I keep it moving  one of my favorite moments of this  experience sharing the stage with  Tatiana the shut up and drive lip sync  Rihanna if you're watching this just  know that we celebrate you us queens and  we thank you for Shut Up and Drive okay  here is the story about the shut up and  drive lip sync it was fate because me  and Tatiana didn't even plan that in  fact when we get back after the comedy  challenge in the workroom I went to the  right she went to the left and we were  focused I get on my outfit she gets on  hers we meet back on the main stage and  as we're walking on the runway we look  at each other it's like the ying and the  Yang we both high five each other  followed up by a hug and we say let's  put on a show talk about the eye of the  tiger that moment will live rentree in  my head for the rest of my existence  because now that's a legendary lip syn  for your life and we were both in it to  win it and when R called out Tatiana as  the winner I'm sitting over there going  oh my gosh this is it it's the end for  me I thought I was going to get it and  then she says that I'm coming back as  well and the girls in the back are  cracked because the rolls are about to  revers and they surely did you all seen  it there it  is there it is and I'm back in the  competition for one more day until the  Curts dropped right in front of my face  oh I knew who I was eliminating cuz I  said honey if I'm going to be back in  this work room I can't do no negativity  no energy baby we got to Sage this room  we got to get that energy up out of here  this is drag it's not personal let's  have fun you know I've heard in other  reality shows you're in one day and  you're out the next yeah that goes for  rupa's drag race too cuz the R's done  reversed you both earn the power to  eliminate one of the bottom  two and coincidentally me and Tatiana  pull the same Queen's lipstick it's not  personal it's just  drag sharing the sage with my sister  Tabitha my baby sister was such a huge  breakthrough moment for me let's give a  big drag race family welcome to Alyssa's  sister Tabitha it was an opportunity for  me to break down those walls share my  vulnerability and you know I've always  done drag as an escape sometimes from  the world it's like I feel like Alice  like I fell down a hole and I'm in this  fabulous wonderlands full of color but  this was a moment I got to really allow  my vulnerability to show I don't think I  was prepared for it when my sister  walked in the room it was like the  competition stopped it just froze for a  minute I never would have imagined I I  get to share this with one of my family  members this was a little piece of home  and I remember hugging her so tightly  that was such a very real loving  heartfelt moment I think this moment  definitely impacted my relationship with  her she always celebrated me from being  the little boy in the neighborhood that  trolled a on and danced up and down the  sidewalks and then seeing me on  television as her big brother that was a  drag performer extraordinaire but  getting to share the sage with me  getting to be in the work with me  getting to see my process up close and  personal I remember her telling me I  have so much more respect for you and  for what you do and the amount of work  that you put in the attention to detail  I remember her telling me Justin that's  my government nay you were born to be a  star shine brightly and that was so  special to me that's something I will  never forget so RuPaul thank you and  that's the power of drag and my sister  is a southern lady so when I got  eliminated she was h o t t o g o hot to  go did I spell it right she was so proud  but she's like you deserve to win this  and I said well thank you for loving me  but just when I thought my Drag Race  book closed slam shut there was a plot  twist because here I am now on the  world's largest stage and fiercest  worldwide drag competition Global all  stars from all the drag race Queens in  the world I've chosen each of you to  represent your nation I know a lot of  people think that I'm coming back just  to try to win another Crown but honey I  got a whole mantle full of them this is  a personal goal of mine I wanted to show  the world that the old broom still  sweeps mops and vacuums just when you  thought you knew and you'd seen it all  oh y'all better Buckle in put the  harness down like you're on one of those  roller coaster that goes upside down and  sideways cuz she's already and that's me  to reign supreme that is but just when I  thought I did it all she's back back  back again stay tuned a Once In  a-lifetime global drag competition is  here being here representing American  drag which I'm so very proud of and the  rest is hory my story that is always and  forever Alysa Edwards",

      "page_content": "hey everyone Jared Hall in the  Entertainment Weekly Comic-Con 2024  studio with the cast right now of  Captain America Brave New World uh  coming straight off that big Marvel  panel tonight it's uh that that Saturday  night panel in Hall h is always the uh  the one that everyone wants to be in um  and and these guys were there to  experience it all Harrison Ford Anthony  Macky Dana Ramirez Tim Blake Nelson and  Jean Carlo Esposito welcome uh men  gentlemen sir  that's not the actual billing Mr Mackey  is well above my name well I I I here a  very small part I mean you're the  president so we rence right it's all  about ex um but actually Jean Carlo i'  actually like to start with President  which you know yeah no no big deal no  big deal um but I want to start with you  because you are uh Sidewinder king of uh  the serpent society and a few years ago  um we were teased that there would be a  serpent Society film but then we were  like oh this is all a fake out but it is  actually official it is really happening  so what kind of what kind of new flavor  new elements uh will will this uh this  guy bring to the MCU as we know it such  a great question you know I think  there's such great creative minds um in  in the MCU that have decided to go back  in in the the great cycle of comics to  create Seth bulker and the serpent  Society I like it because he's a  complicated guy who didn't start started  an nefarious way and he came to this you  know in a different way which hopefully  will unfold um I like it for me because  you've seen me play certain villainous  characters who use their brain who are  great at dictating what to do and how to  do it um and I like SE wer because he  does it he's a physical guy and he's got  to you know go toe-to-toe with his  physicality and he knows how to use the  tools of his trade so he's someone who  plays against some of the things in the  comic that you may think could be true  all right you like that didn't you great  description and and a nice tease all at  the same time there yeah  answer right he nailed that um you  should hire him uh uh Anthony with um  you know ask somebody I can't go with no  you no it's all you it's all I got to  getap yeah be hold it got um past  Captain America movies um have have  played such a big role in reshaping the  MCU and I'm wondering how this one will  also do that  well I think the you know Brave New  World Is A a great title for this film  just simply because it's a new beginning  it's a foundation on which Marvel will  build uh the Universe on now and I think  not only this character but all the  characters that's Sur him are new uh  Foundation building blocks for us to  utilize to move on through the Universe  um in the near future okay um got that  you got see you follow that just fine  you did just fine there work for all of  us  thank you very much um Harrison we were  talking about fake outs and um there was  a an interview you gave I think it was  last year at sometime and someone asked  about Red Hulk and you said what's Red  Hulk and I'm curious was that also a  fake out did you or did you know at that  point who and what you were be playing  and and the the the lore surrounding  this  character yeah no thank you very much  that's how dumb I am no I  mean but but at that point you didn't  know no but I I didn't know I I was in  on it you know I I I yes I I did know  and I thought it was a fabulous secret  to keep MH unfortunately the Secret's  out of the bag it is yeah so I but but  what I do not know is what what the Red  Hulk leads to which is very interesting  to me that is a Brave New World  well that's what the Brave New World  don't do  that as usual it's all about  him and you know what he's  right it is all about him right  absolutely absolutely I'm just happy to  be here fearless leader to be here me  too but you kept that secret you you  still don't know perhaps the end game  for this character but what were you  excited to find out along the way uh in  terms of like just what got you excited  to play a character like this we've not  seen you in a role like this what I was  excited to do was to work with these  other actors and to make uh Make Scenes  that had uh complexity and drama and  humor MH and these guys all do that uh  really well and uh I had I had the best  time it's it's uh you know I had seen  other actors in the Marvel Universe  well-respected  yeah really good actors yeah have a  really good time I say I want me some of  that yeah get in on it I want me some of  that and uh I got some yeah you get it  while the K's good yes yeah oh yeah well  and I mean Tim knows a little something  about that having played uh Samuel  Sterns 16 years ago I kind of fair to  say the character was never fully  realized so when they came back to you  this time did you have a lot of  questions about where are we going to  take this guy what's going to be the  trajectory I had only one request which  was that um we realized the character  practically and they were willing to do  that of course if they'd said no I still  would have done it but uh but I but I I  wanted really to to have the look and  the weight of the of the character and  and look at in the mirror and see the  deform deformation of the character um  and have the other actors experience  that um and then  also I was convinced he would never come  back but it was 16 years later and the  character has a lot of paos and rage uh  and I needed to grow up a little bit to  meet those challenges as an actor so all  about timing for this one yeah yeah got  to love that um Danny uh how uh does  your uh how is your Falcon distinguished  from Anthony's I'm just happy to be  here gonna say that  forever No it's h it's I think the uh  doing the show I was able to kind of  like art imitated life and life imitated  art where I was able to see Anthony go  through um through these learning  moments as he took on the mantle of cap  and in that same Way by just observing  him process that I was a to just kind of  sit in the and him breaking the wind  through um through that and just not  breaking the wind was yeah him breaking  the wind  consistently a lot of protein shakes you  know those protein who smelt  it those protein F I'm say you guys know  what I meant that's what you said I I  did say I did say it um it's it's  happens a lot Anthony so  oh no it was it was great to see him go  through that and I was just able to  absorb  that wow keep going as  right to absorb it all and move  on I'm happy to be here there full  circle bring it back around happy to be  here um Anthony as we understand it um  lots of actors from the incredible  Hulk uh will be uh worked in here but  I'm actually curious how significant are  the events of that film here the  Incredible Hulk yeah with with those  folks uh it's a different movie like he  green I'm black um it's a whole  different movie man like you know he  don't wear draws like I you know I wear  a costume and a full suit you know it's  it's a whole different thing the the  events of uh Hulk and his film uh don't  pertain to this movie at all  uh when when and  if shows up and he not Red Hulk the  other Hulk there are multiple hulks so  when he shows up yeah but there's only  one red Hulk good there's only one okay  man good that's it solid never be  another red hul I'm happy that's it okay  go on I'm sorry I didn't mean to  interrupt no no no no no when he shows  up his world his Universe his story is  completely separate from from what the  the way we utilize him in our story y um  our time is about up here but um  Harrison I got to ask you uh given that  this of course is uh you know we the the  the antagonist here is King of the

      "page_content": "couple years later I went to buy the box  set of peaky blinders and on the back it  said Killian Dunkirk Murphy job done  hello I'm Christopher Nolan the director  of Oppenheimer here with the cast of the  film and this is ews around the  [Music]  table I'd first heard about Oppenheimer  when I was a kid um we were talking  yesterday about that sting song Russians  you know first to heimer's deadly toys I  was growing up in the UK at a time when  people were very concerned about nuclear  armaments you know it was protests at  greenham comma all of that campaign for  nuclear disarm and I think when I was 12  or 13 I think myself and all my friends  were absolutely convinced that we were  going to experience nuclear war at some  point in our lives and then over time  that fear recedes and and oppenheim  stuck with me as a figure and I learned  more about him over the years including  learning this information that you know  he along with the key scientist of the  Manhattan Project they couldn't  completely eliminate the possibility of  starting a chain reaction that would  destroy the world and for me that that  was kind of the hook it's it's it's such  a dramatic moment I referred to it my  last film tenet I'm just very interested  in in taking the audience into that room  and being there and kind of living in  that moment what what would that have  been like to to push that button knowing  there was any possibility of that  we imagine a  future and our imaginings horrify  us they won't fear  it until they understand it  [Music]  and they won't understand  it until they've used it did you guys  get the three dozen yellow roses two  days in a  row no U Mine was a slower courtship  process cuz he knew for sure I was going  to say yes no matter what I went over to  his house I read it I don't want to  complain but it's on red paper printed  in Black which  is kind of difficult and a bit unnerving  as well yeah I guess there's something  about it that makes it that you forget  it as soon as you read it I don't know  what those colors  are it's kind of like being  hypnotized this is how you this is how  you get what you want Chris's way of  operating is that he just calls you out  of the blue I think you enjoy  that certainly for me it was it just  came completely out of the blue and Emma  called me and then put me on to Chris  and he said he was making a movie about  Oppenheimer and he said I'd like I'd  like you to play Oppenheimer and I had  to sit down and it was kind of  overwhelming which fun way to do it but  it means that in the future it's very  difficult for me to call you to go out  to dinner  or the what's it going to be this is uh  going to sound made up but it's actually  true I had uh not to get too personal  but had negotiated uh extensively with  my wife uh that I was taking time off  and I actually was had enough foresight  I had been an Interstellar and then  Chris put me on ice for a couple movies  so I wasn't in the  rotation but I actually negotiated in  coup's therapy this is a true story The  One caveat to my taking time off was if  Chris Nolan called and this is without  knowing whether or not he was working on  anything because he never tells you like  Killian just calls you out of the blue  it was a moment in my household but uh  so even modern psychology has a caveat  for Chris for Chris you heard it here  first yeah I didn't know the process  right so I didn't know if you were  meeting sort of countless other people  so so we talked for for an hour or so  and then he's just very casual and he  goes so you know it's a part of um his  wife and you know would you like to take  a look and you're like am is this an  offer so then I went into the living  room read the script it was just so hot  racing it was so so awesome it's that  thing you read the script it's written  in the first person you're transported  and it's a journey to read it and then  at the end of that the guy who wrote the  script you just read is asking you if  you want to do it I actually had a  little I I was so blown away by the  script um again Robert say it's in the  first person which I'd never seen before  so rather than say Oppenheimer crosses  the room it says I walk across the room  in in the Pres intense so it's it has  that it it it it has a visceral effect  on you and it pulls you right in and  which is the point he's trying to tell  his readers AKA this us and his crew  this is the feeling of the movie it's  got to go through the subjective lens of  this character and that's what it  entirely rests on that and I was so kind  of floored by how good it was um that  the only thing I said he said what do  you think and I said I have no notes so  snobby which to me snobby it's the  highest compliment  terrible and Chris was thing to say when  Emily read it and EM em was gushing  about it and she was very articulate  Chris said well it's better than what  met  said but I was trying I didn't I was you  know because you're you're a little  stunned when you go I I I have no notes  I I don't I don't know what to say to  you I I can't believe this is amazing  which is you know how I felt watching  the film as well we're in the race  against the  Nazis I I know what it  [Music]  means if the Nazis have a  bomb we have a 12-month Head Start 18  how could you possibly know  that we've got one  hope all America's industrial might and  scientific innovation connected  here secret  laboratory keep everyone there until  it's  done let's go recruit some  scientists build a town build it fast we  don't let scientists bring their  families will'll never get the  best why would we go to the middle of  nowhere for who knows how  long why why how about because this is  the most important thing to ever happen  in the history of the  world you're the great improviser but  this  you can't do in your  head are we saying there's a chance that  when we push that button we destroy the  world chances are near  zero near zero what do you want from  Theory alone zero would be nice I mean  we always knew that the Trinity test  would have to be a showstopper it's the  full Crim that the whole story turns on  and I when I finished the script one of  the first people I I showed the script  to was my visual effect supervisor B  because I wanted to take CG off the  table and see if you know he could come  up with real world methodologies for  producing the effect of you know the  first atomic blast but even more than  that I wanted to see how we were going  to try and look into op's mind and see  his thought process of you know as I put  it looking into dull matter and seeing  energy there and seeing the potential of  the strong force there to be to be  Unleashed on the world and and sort of  draw that thread with symbolic imagery  and visualizations of the quantum world  and everything so Andrew Jackson I've  worked with for for several films um he  won an Oscar for tenant um I work with  him for years and he understands both  the computer world but he also  understands the analog world he's he's  wonderful with that and so he spent  months and months and months doing all  these experiments and figuring out all  these methods some very very small  microscopic some of them absolutely  colossal and then the process of going  out to the desert you know with Ruth D  Young Building the bunkers as they would  have been so that we could shoot in the  middle of the night in the desert in the  real places and get these guys there to  to Really experience some measure of  what that tension would have been like  that crazy night of building up and the  weeks before building up worrying about  the weather we're very fortunate the  weather did all the things we needed to  do it got crazy when we needed to get  crazy on on C it was really hypnotized  it was really wonderful it happens for  you a lot doesn't it uh I you know I I'm  rumored to be lucky with weather I I  think we make our own luck though cuz  we're all we always shoot no matter what  the weather yeah we don't stop we don't  wait you know I mean on Interstellar we  they kicked us off the glacier finally  we shot in the car park you know and the  shot which you said wouldn't be in the  film is actually it's in the movie you  were right you were right uh but that's  the thing is is you know we're always  prepared to try and use what what nature  gives us give us a real texture and in  the case of the New Mexico desert it it  just paid such dividends I mean that  weather that came in you know as you  guys are doing the scene by the wood  wall with the initial test detonation  and and we had to suddenly wrap cuz  lightning came over but the the clouds  that came over I mean all of it just  informs the whole you know the whole  drama of the piece and the buildup to to  Trinity is the key it's really all about  the tension leading up to it and what  the process that they went through and I  was very blessed that that the designer  Ruth dong and Scott Fisher the visual  effects supervisor you know when we were  trying to make our budget work and and  all that and it said of like what do you  need to see of the gadget itself and I  was like well we only see it in these  shots and those shots and they ignored  that completely for me and they built  the entire thing in exacting detail so  that we were then free to shoot the  entire process you know the shrink  wrapping on it as it comes up in the  truck that gets cut off the way that the  the different modules are inserted in  and wired up and we were able to build  the tension up to the detonation by  showing that process that that they went  through and I think it's so important  and and that's what you get I mean you  know obviously with wonderful actors  coming on and bringing uh you know new  takes new thoughts new research to  everything particularly dealing with  with real people but I had that from  every Department I had that from um you  know from Ruth and from ho the Director  of Photography everybody coming with  ideas and knowledge about how this could  work better and that that sequence is  built on on those building blocks this  is a peculiar way that Chris works you  don't see a frame of the film while  you're shooting there's no video Village  there's no monitors there's no playback  which is weirdly liberating you know  you're you're never reflecting you're  just moving forwards all all the all the  time so I haven't seen a frame of the  film except for that little teaser that  you guys put out and then we and then I  saw the movie how do I kind of phrase  this properly uh it was absolutely  staggering I I found it absolutely  staggering and and it was I was like it  was like I was kind of uh emotionally  winded you know I mean it's it's it's  not great looking at yourself but you  can get over that when the film is as  brilliantly constructed and made as this  as this film is and and I remember we  just talked and talked for hours after  after it and it seems that that everyone  who's watching the film it kind of  provokes that very very intense debate  among people that have have seen it  because the the teams that it's  interrogating are just the biggest teams  of of of of all you you you know and  it's and it's and it's as as Matt said  like it's so visceral and it it kind of  grabs you by the throat and just you  just you're just in it for the whole run  yeah I was a little over  overwhelmed uh still  recovering there's English  modesty and then there's Irish  Killian it's been really difficult to  try to get through to you what an  amazing thing you accomplished and I  know it's important for us to kind of  separate from that because that's not  what matters but um well done brother  thanks man we all did it we all we did  no don't don't we did but no but from  the ve from the outset the very first  thing Chris said to me when he talked to  me about it was you know the book that  it's based on is an amazing book won the  PO prize it's called American Prometheus  and Chris said I'm not calling the movie  that I'm calling it Oppenheimer because  that's what this is and this thing rides  on that character on him on that  performance and I need actors in support  of that that's the mission and that  those were kind of our marching orders  and so watching the two of them really  because I do think of it as a  partnership when you're putting  something of this scale on the back of  one performance the director and actor  have to be in complete sync and have to  it has to be a partnership Chris has to  put the camera in the right place and  Killian's got to you know what I mean  it's like it they both have to be be  working in concert and that's that was  what was really fun to watch and it was  great to parachute in and watch that as  as Robert says this kind of holy  monastic kind of uh um mission that  these two were on together and to and to  and to Bear witness to it because it  really is one of the great screen  performances I think of all time yes on  your last day you took me aside and said  you realize what this guy's doing every  day he's killing for you but with good  humor  and do you understand how exhausting  that is how difficult it is and you must  take that for granted and I thought  about that and I was like no he loves  it two words will not be  SM thanks for convening a short notice I  can't believe believe  it but here we are this Atomic  test the Russians have a bomb we're  supposed to be years ahead of them  but what were you guys doing in Los  [Music]  alos and how many people were in these  uh open discussions too many  compartmentalization was supposed to be  the protocol we were in the race against  the Nazis  so now the race is against the Soviets  not unless we started Robert they just  fired a starting  [Music]  gun what's the nature of the device they  detonated data indicates it may have  been a plutonium implosion device like  the one you built at Los Alamos yeah  there's a difference between or  organized focused and  controlled and I think all of us can say  we've worked with a director or 17 in  the past that may confuse those and it's  about control and I never saw a mark on  the floor I was never told what to do or  not do I was more than occasionally  asked to do nothing which is a really  interesting bit of feedback because I  think there's still some part of me that  wants to please the director by doing  something  and I think also you knew because of how  rich the format is how much of the work  was going to be done so it really was a  trust exercise in letting the story the  text and I mean you know all of us are  blessed that we had scenes with someone  who was in so you guys were in a Zone  together given the history you had that  was so fascinating as to this holy  monastic grind you guys were in but you  were kind throughout so you go like I  have nothing to complain about here this  is really  weird what's this new feeling of Peace  there was as little makeup as required  i' just uh gotten  older  true can we cut that  out there was a lot of uh stipple  stretch and stipple a lot of that a lot  of that I mean my wife said great now I  see what I'm getting in 15 years I knew  Killian from quiet place 2o so of course  I called him and I said like what's it  like come on tell me and he just said  you're going to just love it you're  going to love it it's so focused there's  no chaos it's very giving it's  collaborative and how amazing he was  with actors and I think that is the  great beauty of what Chris does is that  there are directors who are led by the  visuals or there's directors who are  pretty good with actors but you just  never find that where someone is just  sort of as mirly brilliant at both so I  was excited about the focus of it I  think I was excited about the screws  getting tightened on everybody and what  that atmosphere will feel like on a film  set it's also the other thing he gives  you is that you feel safe and I think  usually you're on a film set where you  might not like the script that much or  you just kind of don't really trust that  scene or that note or that thing and  there's none of that all of that just  gets kind of washed away and it gives  everyone Wings on their heels you know  it just makes people perform at a level  that we're trying to kind of match what  Chris does and yeah the screws  tightening that's the feeling I loved so  much every day with Killian I would  start would preface it by saying that I  was just marveling at what he was doing  and and not doing and um and all of it  and then and then I I was very genuinely  surprised with uh Jason Clark who plays  Roger Rob the first time I sat in that  room and was cross-examined by him and  he he he just started lethal is the  perfect word he's fantastic and  intimidating and intimidating and it was  just it was great and I looked at him I  went okay this is you know and I  completely out I'm I'm I'm a general I  wasn't worried about him at all but but  but I looked at him and went this this  is you know and that was the thing is  that every actor goes there very  prepared very I think excited probably a  little nervous to be working with Chris  and and um and and you feel it when you  walk on the set you feel through  throughout every apartment and um you  know it's like this is the place and  you're at it and um and that's really  exciting this is a matter of life and  death but I can perform this  miracle World War II would be over our  boys would come  home that's happening isn't  it  world will remember this  day I mean I had so much with Killian  who is so transporting to be in a scene  with and just pulls you right inside of  it you know whatever the scene is he can  take a slap I'll tell you that much  really I mean I really didn't want to  hit him you know and Chris was like hit  him he's he'll be fine and I can see  this the his rather famous cheekbone  just sort of start to grow like even  more on one side by the that scene I  really enjoyed um where it's a really  difficult scene for to play you know  where he's literally sort of gibbering  with incoherence and he's having an  episode and it was just so raw and  emotional and it was one of those days  we sort of I think we were losing the  light and it was like but Chris doesn't  kind of let you feel the chaos but I  think we knew you know that we had to  get it and it was just a very heated  exciting scene and to see this great man  this powerful man so delicate so  vulnerable it's just the full spectrum  of what Killian can do you know and can  I just say like when with that scene in  particular I think I don't know if I'd  been able to get to that place you know  if it wasn't for working with Emily  because you need that level of trust for  a scene like that you know and I think  the fact that we know each other and  she's such a like phenomenal actor that  we were able to to go there you know and  I think trust you know with Chris and  trust with Emily and in terms of for me  like every day I was working with the  best actors in the world you know every  single day and you you know you look at  the call sheet it would be like Gary  Oldman one day and then Ken Brana and  then unbelievable these guys you know it  was very hard to be cynical when you're  working with that level of of of talent  working with Florence was amazing I mean  I i' followed her her work over the last  few years was really excited to work  with her and I had no idea what that  would be like uh but you know I mean I  think she's just a wonderful presence  and yeah I feel like you guys connected  immediately I think I did with her as  well uh I just found her to be  extraordinarily well very professional  but what a talent I mean what a pres so  so tal yeah it's her presence she has  this incredible presence on screen and  and in person super charismatic yeah so  charismatic a very tough tough role very  precise the screen time short but so  important in alim's life I mean just  really the the root of so many things  that then happen in his life own the  four of us were sitting around last  night the actors here and Robert said  you know appropo of nothing he said you  know this next Generation coming behind  us is really good yeah um you know and  she's she's leading that that group  she's really really great present  company excluded most every scene I had  was with Alden eron Reich and Scott  Grimes and Al and I literally because  you put us at Close Quarters we're kind  of like good friends now and stayed in  touch and it's always great when that  happens and then in watching the  film uh I was just re- reminded of how  good Casey Affleck is so good I was like  that may be one of the coolest Yeah  couple scenes I've seen in a decade yeah  and then of course uh Ramy Malik comes  in for one day and it was an absolute  mic drop moment so it almost transcends  this sense of we're making each other  better because the competition it was  almost like you were participating in  and watching three generations of actors  all come in kind of and almost like with  a Summer Stock level of hey let's let's  there's a barn let's make a show and  let's do it for Maestro there's this  show I used to watch on uh on the  History Channel It's called man moment  machine the moment was when we shot this  thing and I'm sorry but you are the  machine as is the format you used I I  was surprised every day but somebody  would bring something you to the table  and that's that's the joy of working  with a great cast uh and then give  giving them the authority in the room to  play because it's a true story so they  can do the research they can find out  about their characters and I think for  me one of the more invigorating secren  is the GAC meeting where leis STW you  know calls the meeting comes late at  night and then we did a lot of  improvisations with that with Dane danan  and Matthew Modine and everyone I don't  if you remember where we got Dane to  just go very over the top to to prompt a  discussion and prompt a different set of  directions in it and that was really uh  really really interesting scene to watch  everybody contribute something uh you  know from Josh hartnet to Matthew Modine  to danaan to these guys just bringing  something literally to the table and  that scene scene around there I I really  really enjoyed that  sequence our work here will ensure a  peace mankind has never  seen until somebody builds a bigger one  you are the man who gave them the power  to destroy  themselves and the world is not  prepared  8  7  6  5  4 3 Truman needs to know what's next 2  what's next why people who know nothing  about opheim are going to get the most  out of the film I think when I read  American Prometheus you know it just  started to discover all of these  Stranger Than Fiction aspects to his  story and the complexities of it and  there were things that you just would  never put in a script as as a writer of  fiction it wouldn't be credible um but  the real story has those kind of  extraordinary moments um but what we  talked about right from the beginning is  is not an impersonation yeah we're not  making a documentary our responsibility  was to interpret and to produce our  interpretation of the character and and  of of the events yeah like when you  think about what he lived through the  the Journey of his the story of his life  it's kind of Staggering it was this kind  of this mad kind of Confluence of like  you know politics and Science and War  was the most exciting and terrifying  time to kind of live through and and it  the story of his life is is fascinating  that's obviously why you thought it  would Merit a movie yeah and I think the  connection I mean one of the first  things I grabbed a hold of from the book  as I was reading it the first time was  the moment you realized that Los Alamos  you know which would become so important  in history is just this place that he  and his brother like to go camping and  that that connection the personal with  with the historic uh I thought was was  really engaging yeah many people will  say this is  uh your greatest film and a culmination  of aspects of every film you've ever  done it's almost like Goodwill Hunting  you've made this equation where you're  now at the end of the chalkboard and  what the heck would you do next but we  believe in you sir so my favorite film  of yours is whatever the heck you do  after this cuz you better come up with  something amazing great answer you're in  all of them no I'm not no I remember  seeing Interstellar in the in the IMAX  on my own and I just remember coming out  like in a terrible State just it was so  emotional and you know else want to  watch it with you did you I love  escaping from the house okay my kids  were little but the you know it's just  it's so emotional that that movie that  it always gets me that movie every time  I love Dunkirk I love Dunkirk I've seen  that like 20 times I want to make the  case for Dunkirk cuz when I said Killy  in the script he wasn't entirely  enthusiastic about playing the character  at s and you actually called me up and  we're like sure I'll do it you know  because I want to work with you but  couldn't I be a Spitfire pilot instead  and I and I said no but I I need you out  on that boat I I know that it's an  experimental script it's not fully  formed but you know come along and we'll  find it together out there on the water  with Mark R to be the horn a little it  was a little bit of that and I um and  you know so I I convinced you and then  you're out on the boat and you're diving  in the water off the wreck and doing all  this like stuff and feeling more and  more miserable about it all but cut to  couple years later character doesn't  even a name all that a couple years  later I went to buy the box set of peaky  blinders and on the back it said Killian  Dunkirk Murphy like job  done my wife and I watched The Prestige  I think four day Prestige four days in a  row when it came I love Inception as  well I I that's kind of an impossible  question it's like saying what's your  favorite Hitchcock movie Ben and I  growing up we went to two movies every  weekend that was well we did um  sometimes more I heard about this you  know with Oppenheimer and Barbie open  and I and I thought you know I think  it's great I I'm I'm glad that we're  we're putting great options back in the  multiplexes it's thank God

      "page_content": "something was happening on the back of  my leg getting scraped against this  truck I got a bruise on the back of my  leg that this guy is going to complain  about the one day he got it was this  big the pitch was just the Guy meets a  girl they go on this amazing date they  hit it off right away and then she  ghosts him disappears he flies over to  kind of pursue the the romance that he  felt only to find out she's a spy and it  just it just felt like a movie that I  grew up on like something that like you  know from the '90s where it was just a  fun concept you know a little bit of a  roll reversal in terms of you know  gender norms and things like that but  but it just felt like a fun thing that  was very rewatchable movies that I just  don't see enough of right now and I just  thought it would be a you know a fun  ride most Action characters I've played  are the ones saving the day and Cole is  the one who needs saving um which is  nice you know it's not only nice for you  know the experience of not having to  work anywhere near as hard as an did  while on set um but but it's fun as an  actor to play someone that is um human  that reacts to things the way most of us  would which is you know Panic as soon as  I read the script I was like this is a  lot of fun if I can imagine my next 3  months of work with these two guys it I  can see that this is going to be a lot  of fun they gave me the chance to come  on board as an executive producer too  and participate in that stage of the  process and have a voice always and and  be creative with them and work on the  script and share notes and back and  forth and you know kind of like have  something to say in the creation of you  know who sad was it was a good  collaboration It's a grand romantic  gesture that is amazing mate 5,000 miles  to surprise a girl who you've only met  once especially if she's the one who  ghosted  you no no she didn't ghost me she just  doesn't have an international calling  plan oh right  [Music]  where am I oh God do you have the wrong  guy I'm a farmer wait  [Music]  wait can you walk go for me these two  characters the whole story is very  relatable they present themselves as as  everything is going the way they want  and they've made the choices of having  life that they have and everything is  fine but underneath that is just they're  very afraid of of going deeper and  showing themselves you know being  vulnerable and loving and jumping off  the cliff with someone else she's you  know I I really like that she was so  strong and skilled and prepared and she  was number one at the agency and she  gets all the toughest and difficult  missions and and at the same time she's  is just really scared of loving someone  and losing that person once she meets  Cole it's just really hard to keep on  the contrast of that that conflict was  really cool I love hanging out with Anna  but but with this film we actually got  to kind of be you know Charming together  and sweet yeah we don't hate each other  in this yeah exactly we're not so  adversarial it's actually you know fun  reparte and that was something we hadn't  had a chance to do yet it's just a fun  journey to go it's very Romancing the  Stone you know what I mean you have very  different people that for some reason  are drawn to each other but put in these  heightened circumstance where you strip  away comfortable conditions it brings  out very truthful and honest reactions  to to you know someone that you not that  long ago had a very wonderful romantic  intimate connection and all of a sudden  you have to level jump you know into  this extreme you know situation yeah I  mean they don't have the time to  actually get to know each other slowly  they're just like everything is really  rushed and they just start finding out  everything like for real what's going on  with each other and of course they're  going to fight and of course they're  going to argue it's like everything is  is like every other relationship just  very rushed and in very extreme life or  death situation which is what what makes  it more endearing and and funny I like  the moments in between the battles you  know the battles are funny because you  know s's in her element Cole is  terrified but those calm moments where  Cole feels like to he wants to be upset  if this were a normal circumstance you'd  have the space to kind of have a  discussion about why you felt betrayed  and you hurt the trust and but you know  you're dodging bullets and so you know  anytime the action calms a bit  Underneath It All there's a real human  story who are you  CIA so confused they kept asking me  about the tax man they asked you about  the taxman they think I am a Taxman  you're the tax man oh my God oh my God  to be in a movie that does have such  amazing action but I don't have to do  any of it was fantastic my experience in  bond was very short not  just come on you stole yeah yeah yeah I  don't mean only in the movie like screen  time but also preparing for it I didn't  have time compared to this one I was  training for months I had to carry on  for the most part all the all the big  stunts which was again very excited and  give me the chance to like get better at  it I feel like there is this sense of of  you know only man can carry a an  action-packed  movie and this is clearly an example of  that not being the case I wanted to look  like legit I wanted to do it right I was  not going to settle for a so so whatever  take I would go back to the Monitor and  try to be as perfectionist as I always  am and do it again and again and again  to improve and do it better so that was  very exhausting but very rewarding I  felt like the characters were worse the  pain that you have to go through she did  this sequence where she you know beats  up three guys and flips some guy over  her head and I just was like whoa all  right she's been she's been doing her  training you know what's difficult for  me to hold up a gun it is hard every  time I see a scene in a movie someone  has to do it the whole it's incredibly  if it's a pistol like a small gun it's  fine but as long as this gets a little  bigger forget it like I cannot do a one  hand I would just go  like he was either up or down but never  straight I really like the plane  although I feel like we were in that  plane forever there was something about  just kind of a really you know tight  space although you know I like the bus  too I don't know I don't know if I could  have a favorite the last scene in the  restaurant was tricky also Tech  technically that restaurant was actually  spinning it's a beautiful concept great  idea very tough uh when it comes to film  making you know we had pieces of set the  wall of the restaurant that you had to  put completely flat on its back and we  would lie down and the cam was going  over you know these Illusions to achieve  very difficult stunt pieces there were  all the characters were on set everyone  was there was packed it was complicated  we were there also for a couple weeks  shoting the scene a lot of coverage I  was once again in dress and hi  heels that was made things a little bit  more complicated too for me a few  injuries bruises everywhere but I also  bruise I mean I sneeze and I bruise so  you know it's also like very challenging  for me there was nothing to hide could  couldn't put any pads pretty sure some  of the money for CGI went to cover in my  bruises you got me kidnapped and  tortured all after one  day I swalled a rock  you're the one who flew to  London it was a romantic  gesture some of my favorite romcoms  are I like what do I like I like nodding  Hill I likeing Hill too I'm going to  just say I like Love Actually when Harry  who just going to say when Harry M he's  a class sit in the plane the other day  and I was last sleeps in Seattle but is  that like a romcom that's like almost an  elev I mean it's such a good movie  Sleepless in Seattle is great oh I know  I'm missing a good one and then tonight  I'm going to be like ah I like Gross  Point Blank That's a romcom kind of  again it's like this it's almost like an  elevated romcom cuz the writing and  acting is so good Serendipity I haven't  seen  Serendipity really what I guess I'm  watching Serendipity tonight who hasn't  seen Serendipity is that is that uh Kate  Beck yeah and  John I guess I know it I don't know why  I love Han Solo and Princess Leia they  have such a good Dynamic that was always  kind of the model for this movie this  kind of you're barking at each other but  it's because you really like each other  maybe Richard Gear and Julia Roberts  that's a good I was going to say Julia  and George Clooney too sure and Julia  and Hugh Grant Julia has done really  well for her she she's really good for  her oh Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore  that's a good little Duo isn't it 51st  dates classic it's funny when you you  know look at your career from 10,000 ft  up and you see man I've done a lot of  book movies or a lot of action movies  lately or whatever it is I I don't know  that there's necessarily a plan in terms  of like you know what I'm tired of this  genre I want to explore that genre  usually it's the people you know it's  the director your co-stars and and if  they happen to be doing a you know  horror movie looks like you're doing a  horror movie I don't think genre is the  thing that steers the ship it's usually  you know the people you got to go to  work every day with I love Steve Rogers  he's very very dear to me but that's  exactly the reason that I'm hesitant to  revisit because it is so precious to me  it's this little shiny thing that I have  that I'm just so proud of and and to  revisit it would have a lot of  implications and and you want to make  sure that it would need to be told they  did a a comic uh signing in Chicago  recently and yeah they they wanted to  know if I was going to come back and I  said look do I think there's more  stories to be told with Steve Rogers  sure but but that doesn't mean you jump  back into it what that period of time  was what Marvel accomplished during that  decade of weaving these movies together  in a way that no one's ever done it and  having such a good you know Landing with  endgame really tough to want to mess  with that I love the character I would  obviously love to keep playing him  forever but but it just doesn't really  make sense to me right now didn't it  never occur to you that he could be a  for asset trying to compromise your  mission who the hell are  you I'm the boyfriend we just make a  very cute  pair we're really I think it's is a very  sweet very Charming story and these two  characters are very lovable and and easy  to connect with and I think people are  going to enjoy seeing both of us mostly  Chris uh going through this adventure if  a movie is done well like this it's like  comfort food you know what I mean you  have a little personal connection with  it and you can watch it 100 times and  never get tired of it it's a Feelgood  movie children can watch this and  teenagers and young people older people  I don't know like it feels like it's a  family movie if these are characters  that people gravitate towards and it's a  fun ride it's fun to revisit I mean it  definitely the end in leaves it open for  something more missions if they promise  me I will have as as much fun as I had  in this one I will definitely go back",

      "page_content": "why is he going to such lengths to  rescue a perfect strange Perfect  Stranger because you know this woman you  know it makes way more sense  it's perfectly fine you just don't know  [Music]  yeah Charlie actually started a plumbing  business I did I did you give up on  Always Sunny for what six months six  months yeah Plumbing I did 17  000 toilets yeah he's licensed and  bonded I am Luigi I should be able to  fix this train uh and I will I mean yeah  I do pretty well I don't use the coat  hanger but I've got one of the snakes  that I got on Amazon it goes down deep  we didn't have to call anyone you know  they would have charged us a lot I got  it and I'm walking Mario's tripping yeah  yeah Mario stage  we did it but yeah I'm good at Plumbing  what was the question uh how we find our  characters a lot of this yeah  prom a lot of trying things out a lot of  trial and error oh we're the Mario  brothers and plumbings again we're not  like the others who get all the things  we're faster than the others you'll be  hooked on the brothers it was a really  exciting and daunting challenge I mean  talking to these guys they say you want  to do the Mario movie I think both of us  said yes yeah absolutely didn't even ask  like well what's what's the deal what's  the story it's like yes I'm in and then  we had to really dig in and figure out  who these guys are I mean we know Mario  and Luigi they're these ubiquitous  characters perhaps the most iconic video  game characters of all time really it's  been almost 40 years that people have  been playing them but you really don't  know that much about them so are they  Italian are they American we know a  little bit of Charles martinet's voice  that he's he's sprinkled in there with  the woohoo and the it to me and these  Mario things you know but how do you  craft a 90-minute narrative with an  emotional through line and create a  living breathing person about whom  you'll care and you'll you'll you'll  hope that they can accomplish their  dreams and that they can rescue their  their brothers and the brotherly love  and the and the you know relationships  with the father and all of this stuff  that if you strip away the jokes and the  magic and the mushrooms and the  power-ups and the color and the Amazing  Music it should be like a pretty good  drama which really uh is the key to a  great story right what's the heart and  soul of the story and then we would try  different things  yeah yeah all right yeah right yeah yeah  I think you're wrong but fine yeah you  know I'm just like until they kind of  landed on something they liked I I for a  minute I walked in and they were like  that's a little Tony's that's a little  New Jersey you're doing a little Tony  Soprano thing you know I was like  what neighborhood in Brooklyn you're  talking about are we talking about you  know Ben Stein we're talking about Park  Slope what are we talking about here  until we landed on it and then uh I  think nailed it  I finally found it now who's gonna stop  me  one of the cool things about Bowser was  how insecure he is his vulnerabilities  were what was really interesting and  funny to me because on the one hand he's  this fire-breathing giant monster and on  the other hand he's this uh very  sensitive kind of romantic who has this  sort of unrequited love he's filled with  greed and jealousy those are fun juicy  things to play I'm a pretty greedy and  jealous person and my darker corners of  my own soul like for instance I have  been jealous I just was thinking about  this of every single person in this cast  uh Star-Lord I was so jealous I was like  I want to be a hilarious superhero in a  movie Always Sunny in Philadelphia I was  like I want to create an incredible  comedy show key and peel I want to be in  the greatest comedy duo of television  history and Anya I don't want to be a a  chess champion genius I've had the that  kind of jealousy in me so in a way I  felt like I was born to bring that  jealousy out in in Bowser it's possible  that Bowser sings a song in this movie  it's possible that Bowser has one of the  great heavy metal Ballads of love but  you're gonna have to see the movie to  find out if that's true destroy the  Mushroom Kingdom  Bowser is coming I'm not afraid I'll do  anything for my brother we're going to  save him  when I was first approached about  playing Princess Peach I was  unbelievably excited Super honored and  also slightly terrified because I only  wanted to play her if she was a 3D  character if she had her own agency and  also she's not just a princess she's a  leader and this is where I get really  really nerdy so if you think about it if  you're the leader of a Mushroom Kingdom  which is a flourishing society and  you're constantly being put in a  different castle and kidnapped you're  not a very good leader and your Society  wouldn't be flourishing so I think this  is the way that she was always supposed  to be portrayed I don't think I would  have done it otherwise and we've had so  much fun bringing Peach to life and what  I was not expecting was how much of an  emotional reaction I would have had to  seeing the film because the idea that  kids are going to grow up with this  being the example of what a princess is  just feels uh very cool and very  inspiring you know what I think is  actually very interesting is that in the  film Anya Princess Peach if anything she  is as a leader she's helping Mario  it's it's almost it's almost like the  exact opposite of what the game used to  be if you think way way way back when to  Donkey Kong to the very first OG DK game  she's just standing there ineffectually  next to Donkey Kong and Mario's to come  and save her and then that  ineffectualness kind of you know found  its way into other games and what's so  funny is in the movie if anything she's  the one who's leading everybody and  she's the one who's helping Mario I just  love that juxtaposition the the movie to  the games so and in terms of their  relationship together I think it's  wonderful because they both need each  other in order to complete their task  Princess Peach needs to protect the  Mushroom Kingdom she needs Mario and  that because he's going to help her  unify everybody and then Mario needs to  find Luigi and he needs Princess Peach's  understanding of how the universe's work  how the power-ups work and so they help  each other which I think is really  prissy I played the OG uh arcade game of  Mario Brothers as well as the NES Super  Mario Brothers game and in that yes it  was always either Luigi or Mario trying  to find the princess in the castle I'm  sorry Mario Princess Another Castle that  in fact wasn't Princess Peach that was  just the princess the Princess Peach  came I think a few games later maybe it  was Odyssey or something yeah to where  it was actually a fully fledged  character so the princess was just like  the purpose for going through these  little levels is go find the princess  but when Peach came around she was  actually a full-fledged Avatar type of  character from Mario Kart one you could  select to be you know in um also maybe  Super Mario 3. I can't remember exactly  when people also like why is he going to  such lengths to rescue a perfect  stranger Perfect Stranger because you  know this woman you know it makes way  more sense too as far as it as far as we  know she's in a  and she's perfectly fine  yeah exactly you know it's all very  unclear it is unclear so it makes a  little more sense narratively for me to  be like my brother's gone I'll go to  Every length to save my brother right  100 yeah and traditionally  Mary plumbers you know until they they  really got to know them well yeah it  took a while yeah that's right  traditionally princesses were kind of  like colonialist like nightmares like  they would actually yeah the plumber  usually typically a plumber would not  have a shot at all not once because a  plumber being a member of the  proletariat or the surf class yeah you  know yeah exactly yeah typically not  typically not even having any kind of  Avenue to a princess if you if you if  you know you know she really wanted the  plumber for the plumbing she said if  this guy rescues me I got a bunch of  sinks that I'm working it's a castle  it's hard to keep the plumbing going she  does have a long luxurious hair well I'm  just impressed by Chris's encyclopedic  knowledge of of uh all things Nintendo I  always assumed that the princess and  Donkey Kong was Princess Peach but now I  realize I've been a fool all day talking  about Princess Peach and Donkey that  wasn't Princess Peach that was just  princess yeah the character development  they were like princess not good enough  color Princess Peach now we've got the  character development that's  deserving they had to test that a bunch  you know they went with Princess kumquat  princess Apple princess apricot none of  it princess pear she was close that came  in second yeah I think it's rad how  Princess Peach kicks butt in this movie  I think I think uh kids are going to  flip out over it uh and also she's a bad  on the motorcycle if you can see Mario  Kart she's ready to go she's probably  got the best backdrop oh wow love these  pipes  [Applause]  oh here we are Palace doors  [Music]  you think about toading the game really  he's kind of a collection of  exclamations more than anything else so  it's just lots of wow you know these  kind of sounds and so I knew that he had  to have a high-pitched voice no matter  what but I really what I did is I based  him on a friend of mine I based his  vocal rhythms and vocal kind of syntax  on a friend of mine and then when I  brought it to the director he was like  okay that's cool I like that stuff but  can we get the voice I we got to get it  higher because we want to make sure  we're referencing all of those those  kind of exclamations that he's making  during the um the games  and I was like sure sure we can I said  yeah we can definitely get higher and  he's like okay that's good what you did  there but can we get higher than that  and I was like uh yeah yeah we can  definitely get higher and he's like can  you get higher than that I'm like uh  yeah yeah I can I can get higher 40  people want to get higher and is can can  is it even possible to get higher than  that and uh  for the entire recording session  we we dropped a little bit we found a  nice little sweet spot for for his voice  but the thing that I love most about him  is that he is he's so willing to accept  a stranger this goes back to Charlie's  point earlier out of nowhere Mario  touches this blue mushroom and I'm only  saying this Jack because it's in the  trailer and he tells them don't don't  touch that mushroom you could die right  he doesn't know Mario Mario could be an  enemy for all he knows Mario could be a  spot a spy of Bowsers or one of the  Kongs but he doesn't he he he's this  kind of very trustworthy optimistic  person who's been spending his entire  life waiting to go on an adventure he  has so much civic pride he would do  anything for the Mushroom Kingdom the  way that Mario would do anything for  Luigi and I wanted to really imbue uh  imbue him with that so that you know you  knew that he was when he's ready to go  on an adventure he couldn't wait to show  off the city the Mushroom City to  um to Mario because he loves the place  so much Keegan your ability to get your  voice higher and higher and higher is  amazing do you know a way someone can  make their voice lower asking for a  friend are there techniques for that or  did you tell the friend that you based  the voice off of he doesn't know yet he  does not know yet will he know I I I'm  gonna spring that on him when the  movie's over in fact if he were watching  this interview right now he's never over  bud it's out forever he's never he's not  then I'm never telling him it's supposed  to sound like me I don't hear it Keegan  your buddy yeah your body is going to be  like I don't know why you think it  sounds like me  dude I I drank a lot of throat code on  this on this movie through all our  recordings too buddy I did too I had  like for me trying to maintain that  voice that was just like gallons of Earl  Gray and honey and really tight pants  who's next I will destroy the Mushroom  Kingdom  what do you guys do that because like I  think that was one of the first things  that really I struggled with was just  going in and I think I was doing like a  six hour session and hour three I was  out it was gone just nothing I could  really do about it other than like  scream cry and push how do you do that  you were like can we just skip straight  to the efforts please oh I've got our  efforts from here on Earth to the  hardest part efforts are the hardest  part and they leave it to the end isn't  the hardest effort when you have to run  so what you're doing is you're going  and you do that all you got to do is do  that for a minute and then fall over  from lack of oxygen to your brain so  lightheaded yeah you get so lightheaded  it gets so lighthead you're just like  but seriously have you guys found  yourself getting better at this the more  that you do it yeah the more you the  more you do it the more you kind of it's  hard to explain sometimes but the more  you figure out the tricks there's tricks  that you can do to help yourself kind of  you know sometimes you just talk in your  head voice for a little bit instead of  keeping your chest because you know when  you're in your chest it affects your  throat more because I've done this a few  times and that's I don't I wish I could  explain it more but there's there's just  a way of you  and then there's a way of like just like  just like going just grinding it through  just getting that Tenacious D of it you  know and and it sounds like I know it's  like a kind of a cliche thing for the  actors doing the vocal warm-ups you know  the  red leather yellow leather red leather  but the older I get I realize I have to  warm everything up like if I'm doing  something physical I have to I really  have to warm up my body and if I'm doing  vocal work I'll drive to the studio and  I'll spend the entire Studio doing like  a whole series of warm-ups to kind of  get my voice ready to go and otherwise I  it does it rips it out you know what I  got better at I think over the over the  course of these recording sessions was  just getting in the spirit of  exploration like at the beginning I was  like okay what I'm gonna do the lines as  well as I can and then and and and I was  pushing up against this uh like no let's  try something different now let's try it  this way let's try it that way once  we're like in the middle of the process  I kind of got comfortable with that was  like okay yeah I'm just gonna do uh I'm  coming to the to the recording session  expecting to try a bunch of different  things and once I relaxed into that I  felt like I was really in the groove you  know I had that same experience the  first couple ones I was just trying to  give them exactly what they wanted and  then by the third and fourth I said I'm  just going to do some things and  hopefully they'll like it yeah they  wound up enjoying that but I think at  first they were just trying to find the  voice it's like trying to build a whole  library of options at first I was a  little frustrated but then once I got in  the groove I was like oh yeah this this  is actually a fun a fun process in the  process for me I would have one of the  lines and I would just not I wouldn't  only say it once I would just I would  just tell them I'm gonna run a series  until I think I have it and then I'll  just over and over and over and over  again then and the way I ended it would  always be like I don't know something  like that like that was it that was the  last time you know like I would give  them 15 options 20 options colloquialize  say something different put into my own  words different tones and then by the  end they'd be so exhausted having heard  all of them then I'm like well that's  everything I just emptied out every  possibility so can we move on also if  they let you improvise sometimes like  you can improvise something prior to the  line and you know what I mean like if  you sandwich the line with improvisation  it'll make the Line Pop you know it  makes the line feel natural and Poppy  and that that was something that I tried  to do sometimes was like just improvise  into the line the spirit of what you're  going to be saying it's almost like  you're speaking your subtext and then  you speak into the line do the line and  then improvise out of the line too and  then it just feels like it's their words  but it's as if it's in your own words I  like to do a couple people takes where  it's like well this is never going to be  in the movie but I'm going to just do  this just for some Giggles we like to  say I'm gonna go crazy on this one it's  definitely gonna be cutting room floor  but then that would lead to something  funny that would be like oh yeah  actually Jack we want you to do that  again but instead of that you know it's  uh the art of messing around right yeah  that's exact I know exactly that feeling  yeah you get like you like you're like  there's no way this is gonna make it in  but somehow it inspires something else  always yeah and it also gives you the  permission to try something that might  not work if you're like I'm gonna show  you how I'm gonna do a version of it  that doesn't work but partly maybe five  percent is like or maybe it will work  and but you're not gonna judge me for it  if it doesn't you know what I mean like  yeah yeah like well here's the bad  version of it and then they tell you it  too and you're like that's just your  idea and you're just you just want that  you know you don't want me to judge you  for that matter like a writer will be  like the joke should be I mean here's  the bad version of it and then they  pitch their joke yeah completely I'm I'm  just thinking it would be awesome to  have it like one take stitched together  of all of the self-judging and the  expletives because I'm gonna do the  okay can I do it again wait that was  terrible please no I'm just gonna no no  no no no don't use that don't use that  because I keep going back please okay  let's try this again oh  oh I rated R version would be amazing  Super Mario uncorked  [Applause]  [Music]  oh my God okay have you guys done  animation both like by yourself in a  booth and then also with other people I  have yeah I've done that yeah what's  that like that's a completely different  experience yeah I I was able to work  with other people in the booth and then  it's well then you just feel like you're  doing a regular old acting exercise I  mean when you get to when you get to  work off of another performer oh man  it's a whole different thing but you  know what though you know what's fun  when you're by yourself is you've got to  tap into that childlike quality that you  had when you were a kid because then  remember you like if you had an  imaginary friend you'd give that you'd  imbue that imaginary friend with all  these different kind of qualities you're  like oh no she doesn't like she doesn't  like cheeseburgers or whatever the case  whatever the whatever the friend's deal  is so I would just be doing that with  you guys in my mind I would be seeing  you in my mind there's something very  Regal about this person or something  very intimidating about this person you  just have to go for it with your  imagination like you would have when you  were eight years old I've done both  where I'm animating done animation where  you have a bunch of people in the room  and then you I've done it also solo I  imagine for like the the sound artist  the mixer it's a nightmare to have a  bunch of people overlapping one another  and so that's really complicated but I  think there's real value in assembling  something in a rough mix when you're all  together you get that comedic value that  magic that the the reacting and that  sort of juice that's you know these  great improv comedians such as you guys  you know Keegan and Jack and Charlie  you're throwing stuff out there there's  a magic that's happening a Synergy of  having performers in a room together and  then you can assemble it there it might  be a nightmare for the mixer but then  you could just go back disassemble it  and get the lines independently and  reassemble it the way that it was  assembled in that magical way I think  that's the best version of doing it also  it's a lot of [ __ ] around and a lot  of wasted time because you can't throw a  bunch of us in a room together and  expect us to efficiently work it  immediately turns blue we immediately  start just doing bits for each other  release the actors derails immediately  so release the actors right exactly  also but you know sometimes another  thing interesting on you is that they  make animated movies differently right  so some people make animated movies  where they're animating to the voice and  if they're doing that then it's like yes  please let us improvise and do whatever  we want because then the animators can  work it on the back end yeah which is a  lot of fun in fact Chris we you and I  did do it together with Lego Movie yeah  we did some together remember that big  room there was a big room of actors like  there were like six of us in the same  room at the same time yeah I remember I  think Lego Movie two I did some stuff  yeah Will Arnett and Elizabeth Banks  Phil Lord and Chris Miller they had  previously done animation but then they  went and did 21 Jump Street and Jonah  and Channing kind of improv improvising  together they realized I remember having  that conversation with them they  realized there was a real value to  letting these actors perform and  discovering some magic that wasn't on  the page and that was why they then  wanted in The Lego Movie uh for some  comedians to be in the room together and  then it worked but also it really didn't  like I don't like it gave them a good  shape to help them write as they're  refining the script come up with some  great improv improvisation get some  magic but yeah ultimately you have to go  and carve that stuff out singularly so  that the sound you know designer can  like  really put their magic touch on it we  could all get together in a room and  just improv some stuff I would like  that if you  if again I would love nothing more than  for all of us to be together and to be  able to play in that way however I will  say that the enjoyment and like love  that I felt towards being able to sit  down as an audience member and just  watch you guys go it was awesome I had  such a good time and there is a real  Beauty in that I just loved it I loved  watching you guys you did such a good  job well back out thank you right back  at you you're holding back I mean  shyness if it gave any more  well this has been so fun you guys yeah  yeah see you next week  foreign",

Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we're joined by Jimmy Fallon oh my  gosh earlier this year he celebrated his  10- year anniversary behind the desk as  host of The Tonight Show starring Jimmy  Fallon before that an Emmy award-winning  run on Saturday night live and now he's  releasing a comedy album for the season  it's called holiday seasoning which is  set to release on November 1st Jimmy  Fallon welcome to the show thank you so  much for having me and I just want to  thank you you've been a great guest on  our show and you've been a fantastic  guest and a Gentleman uh but I'm I'm  honored to be here in the studio with  you in this black void and uh there's no  Escape it's like an escape you're  trapped on the show I'm trapped you're a  hostage on hot ons Jimmy I I don't know  I obviously this is your show I'm  talking too much uh let's get into  [Music]  [Music]  it okay we how to get  you now do you do breading on purpose  yeah cuz it kind of soaks in than a  little bit Yeah y it does  yeah  [Music]  okay can I just say before we even get  through this I love your delivery and  that's why I'm a fan of yours this is  years ago when you had your first on the  show you're very dry you're very smart  uh you're very funny and you get the  joke that before anyone gets it you're  already getting the joke you already  know you already know the punch lines of  what things are about to happen and  that's what makes you kind of crazy  you're kind of a lunatic you you've kind  of tapped into the exactly like I'm just  going to ignore the absurdity of this  whole context right and just through a  very serious intervie you should be  institutionalized that's right yeah so  holiday seasoning is a collection of  original holiday music and you have  these monster collabs with the likes of  Megan Trainer Dolly Parton Ariana Grande  and Meg the stallion what to you are the  Hallmarks of a Timeless holiday song  like what makes the great ones great I  think the great ones great are the ones  you don't really have to think about  much it's just like kind of a earworm  room and you go oh yeah uh Mariah Carey  obviously knows how to do it but uh  growing up I used to listen to you know  darling love and all that stuff and all  this kind of so we have a bunch of good  earworms and just like kind of happiness  and there's a lot of uh ding-dongs on  our album there's a lot of bells ringing  and the ding dong ding dong ding dong  it's like kind of not hille but it's  those types of Vibes that make you happy  and feel good and that's what the  record's all about  [Music]  the ghost pepper pear now they put the  word pear in there as a joke because is  are people really tasting the pear  flavoring well there's only one way to  find out yeah oh know oh no oh it t a  little pear yeah you catch that pear up  front up front oh yeah Little Ghost  Pepper after but nothing you can't  handle I can see oh not bad this is  actually really good this is from New  York City mhm little dicks mhm all right  perfect  pound for pound who would you say is  your most accurate impression like who  do you hit closest to the bullseye in  your mind pound for pound so funny  um this is why you're good pound for  pound is hilarious um impressions of how  we got started someone gave me a troll  doll when I was in high school and so I  didn't know what to do with that but I  go thank you and I entered this  competition my mom was like there's an  impression funniest person in the Hudson  Valley contest at bananas Comedy Club  she goes I hear the voices that you do  in your room you should do these voic uh  you know on on the stage and I go what  else do you hear in my room um and uh so  I I I did this uh thing it was like two  minutes of Impressions and I did you  know um Jerry Seinfeld I did different  celebrities auditioning for the troll  doll to be a spokesman so I'd be like  who does his hair what kind of dolls are  these things who plays with troll dolls  what are these you know where John  travol to like who does his hair like  his hair's so frizzy like what's going  on with this like crazy troll dollar R  so like I did that and I ended up  winning the competition and that was my  first big taste I got  $1,000 damn in 2 minutes and I was like  it's this easy let's do this for the  rest of my life turns out it's not that  easy but for that moment it was one of  my favorite Impressions I ever did which  kind of got me the job for Sant live is  I I did Adam Sandler he he's a good  impression dude because he kind of has  three stages to his voice like his first  he kind of you know kind of nervous and  kind of mumbles and he can talk about  you know I went to my mother's house you  know and she you and then the second  level it gets crazy he's  like how you and then the third level  he's just yelling he's like shut  up you know and so that is three levels  of the same voice of the same person and  so I did that and I made Lauren laugh  which everyone says he won't laugh he  started laughing he put his head in his  hand and I go even if I don't get this  job I made Lauren Michaels laugh in in  studio 8h in NBC and that's what I'll  tell my  [Music]  kids all right smoked onion sauce okay  here we  go yeah it smoked onion mhm it's like a  uh it's like a funion yeah it's a good  way of putting it actually right tastes  like a funion you know we have chefs on  here sometimes that'll just be breaking  down the flavor profiles but I we just  needed you the whole time thank you go  to Boda get a fun  you that's what this tastes like this is  great so congrats by the way on hitting  the 10year Milestone as host of The  Tonight  Show yep thank you very much reflecting  back do you have like a most profound  like wow I wish I knew this sooner  Revelation as a talk show host use fake  things use fake hot sauce um to be  really honest we did a sketch once where  they were um people were dumping um  coolers of stuff on me if I lost a  trivia question about football or  something and they dumped actual Frank's  Hot Sauce oh that's bad on me it was  real bad it actually burned my half my  face was purple like it burned me it  went down my suit I was taking a shower  in milk i' been there yeah right it  doesn't really help this Wing broken too  so I think it  counts I might have eaten an extra Wing  this might history yeah that is put it  in first time on put it in the hot ones  history books Jimmy found ate an extra  Wing right through the bone I ate right  right through the bone these are the  best veneers by the way I have a great  dentist I have the best fake teeth in  the  business okay so we're speaking  different languages  now delicious little vinegar kick to it  mhm um and you're rocking it so far  Jimmy I am mhm you've seen people fall  at this point lesser men okay okay that  one feels great to me that is fantastic  I'm having a great time and if we ended  this whole interview now I would yes I'd  be so happy I go Sean thank you so much  thanks for having me as a guest you're  the best man we'll be right back with  more uh best of hot  ones yeah so as a Yankees fan I'm sure  you're locked into the World Series do  you have a most cherished memory from  that night in 2001 when Derek Jeter  hosted Saturday Night Live I do remember  that I became kind of friends with Derek  Jeter that week and it was as he was  becoming you know next level Derek Jeter  so at this point he was still just fun  kind of rookie good-looking stud Derek  Jeter and he was about to be a legend  you know and I remember he goes uh dude  you want to come to my apartment and I  go uh yeah let's go he goes I just got  this brand new apartment like I no  furniture in it yet or anything I go  let's go dude so we went to Derek  Jeter's apartment and it was on the like  398th floor and was past the clouds it  was like a Mario Brothers level where  you go past clouds and now you're just  in you know you're just looking over the  city giant apartment it looked like an  empty Gap it was just like Giant and Big  windows and we ended up hanging out the  whole night and this the nicest dude to  me and uh I remember going into a shower  and seeing uh a stack of lever 2000 soap  that's the soap D Jeter  [Music]  uses Dawson's hot sauce I remember the  show on  CW I'm so proud of myself you should be  I'm proud of you from this side of the  table yeah I'm sweating a little bit but  not that bad mhm and really from the  waist down really so that's so you can't  really see it uh it's not bad how did  Timberlake do on this oh he's great I  love working with Justin you he told me  you know it was a nice compliment that  he told me he said that hot ones is a  big hit at like the pickup like when  he's picking up kids from uh school like  all the dads would talk about hot ones  the next day and me and Chris I remember  thinking like that's a good show  compliment you know fantastic yeah we're  big at pickup he's the  most if you're good at kids pickup if  you're popular there you know you making  it you you and blue  it he's one of the most talented human  beings on Earth definitely he's a  perfectionist and he's amazing I  remember we were doing s live and we're  as Barry Gibb we're doing the Barry Gibb  talk show the whole idea of the sketch  is that I talk the way Barry Gibb sings  so  I have a great show today and  everybody's having fun H hot ones and  we're having hot sauce and he does that  you know so we're starting the sketch  and we're dressing 70s tuxedos it's all  fun and we're about to go and we start  the we start the episode with my back to  the audience which I always thought is  dumb and funny why would you start your  show with your back face in the audience  and then turn around and go like here we  are in a room you know and so we're  about to go like all right we're on uh  20 seconds to air 15 10 and he goes uh  hey Jimmy remember hit the Harmony and I  go yeah I will man and he squeezed my  hand he goes I'm serious dude remember  to hit that Harmony  I calm down dude like we're dressed like  the bgs dud like dude I he I felt for  that second I felt like what it was like  to be Lance Bass  I mean do I get anything if I finish  this do we have any more t-shirts a  t-shirt I want like a watch or  something I want like something like a  plaque or or a belt we see we'll see  what we can do we'll stress test the  production over the hallway yeah you get  to keep the  sauces no thanks I don't want  them this past summer I got to see  George Went Jason sedus and Robert  Smigel revamped the Super Fan skit yes  as a Saturday Night Live historian  yourself what immediately comes to mind  when you think of like the perfect smnl  sketch I did a sketch with uh will FAL  called cowbell and uh it just Crush I  mean next level everyone was Next Level  everyone was so funny in that sketch  Chris Katan Chris Parnell was great  Christopher Walkin wasn't even talking  like a human being he was doing like an  impression of himself and what is we  need more C he wasn't even speaking  English I don't know what he was doing  and it was crushing and the room got hot  and it shook and I remember I had one  line of course an idiot and I have one  line right as I'm about to give my line  Katan and will improvised and pushed  each other and Katan knocked Will's  sunglasses off and I could see the eyes  of a lunatic and I started laughing and  I go and I started laughing and then  that's what got my r ation of the guy  who laughs during all the sketches but  uh uh that was great uh Debbie Downer I  was a part of that sketch I kept my I  was really solid on that until the way  way way end and so we all broke in the  scene and Fred armon's in the scene the  next day in the New York Post they put a  picture of us and Fred was the only one  laughing in the  photo and I remember going up to him  going how  unprofessional keep it together buddy  yeah  [Music]  ninja Napal oh my  gosh okay and this is right before the  bomb  okay okay don't freak out I'm going to  make it to the bomb and you I'll freak  out all right but this one yeah okay  this one's starting to hit yeah pepper  ninja ninja na  okay oh my God all right  so as a music obsessive do you have a  pinch me musical moment from hosting the  show and working alongside Legends of  yours like Bruce Springstein Neil Young  Keith Richards  well pound for pound  um for pound um these artists are all um  yeah this is where you get distracted  this exactly you I'm doing falling right  into the Trap right here cuz you're  asking a question I don't even remember  the question  and you know I remember doing a thing  with Bruce Springsteen where I was  dressed as him in the 80s and he was  dressed as him in the 70s so we uh we're  about to do it everyone leaves the room  it's just me and Bruce I go put the wig  on he goes all right let's try the wig  so I put a wig on Bruce springen and he  puts a floppy hat over the wig and it  looks exactly like Bruce Springsteen  from the Bor on tour exactly and so we  leave he goes oh I'm going to keep the  wig and he comes out and his manager  John landow is in the dressing room  across the hall from the makeup room and  they looked at each other like and they  both started kind of tearing up well  John definitely did Bruce was wearing  the sunglasses and he's like Jimmy I  can't explain this this is like seeing  your  client looking like how he looked 30  years ago I never thought I'd get that  Feeling Again went rehearsed went great  and then I went back to my dressing room  and I started doing push-ups because  he's he's jacked and I'm not and I'm  like if I'm do BR spring you know get a  pump yeah I got to get a pump in man and  then he walked by my dress he goes  you're cheating man you're cheating and  came over and started doing push-ups  next to me so that was a pinch me moment  I did push-ups next to Bruce Springsteen  dress as Bruce Spring  [Music]  seed here we go this is the bomb and uh  I'm doing this for uh all all my what I  do it for all the kids this for the  kids oh no yep I remember this Yep this  is one that  killed this one that killed s gz  yeah you know we almost killed s g i  remember  vividly and you know my favorite thing  about doing hot ones on The Tonight Show  is that you'll position it in the middle  of oh my God you'll position it in the  middle of the program so you'll still  have to fil like two blocks with your  mouth on fire that's right oh gosh but  eating more doesn't  help no so why would I do that oh my  gosh  mhm why about I do it  here you're making sound effects and  you're acting like it's hot but I don't  think it is hot for you no it is yeah  okay think you're crying a little bit  yeah I  know I'm human  Okay as a host do you ever feel guilty  doing hot ones on The Tonight Show yeah  you know like like I'm stealing someone  else's  bit like I'm stealing your show the  popularity of your show not my show I  guess where I was going with that is  like I'm sure Selena go is much more  dubious of your segment suggestions now  than she used to  be dubious it's the words like that it's  pound for pound it's  dubious oh oh my gosh I'm just I'm out  crying I'm just thinking about me  grandmother and the way we used to laugh  you know in back in  Ireland you almost killed an American  treasure SEL  Gomez almost dude she left and ran out I  went and knocked in her dressing room  door that's my favorite 30 Rock memory  ever she was throwing up in her  sing in her dressing I go s it and she  goes get the F  out with a devil voice I've never seen  her like that uh spit was dripping out  of her mouth and I go I'm so sorry and  uh uh I didn't really talk to we didn't  talk to each other for another 3  years and then when she when she said  that to you and you closed the door you  looked at me and you go she's doing  great yeah I did I exactly did that yeah  things are coming out I can't hear out  of this side so I can kind of guess what  you're saying and I can kind of hear you  do you want some ice cream  no do you want to give me ice cream we  have some waiting in the wigs you think  I can't

      "page_content": "I went to watch the the team train this  morning that is that is not good I know  yeah that is not  [Music]  good hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we deliver you a very special  episode of hot ones brought to you by  Stella Artois the official beer of hot  ones summer and we're joined by Stella  Global Ambassador David Beckham he's a  football legend and cultural icon whose  list of bonafides includes six Premier  League championships a pair of fa cups  and the first English player to have won  League titles in four countries his  contribution to the game doesn't stop  there though as he's now the president  and co-owner of inter Miami where we are  today in fact David Beckham welcome to  the show thank you very much thanks for  having me on slightly nervous can't lie  before we start how are you around Hat's  sauce my wife when I left the house  today she was worried she was worried  she was like any show that has  paramedics on on set is a  [Music]  [Music]  problem  okay it's a good stop  little kick little kick I'm quite hungry  as well haven't had breakfast so there  you go we offer lunch here you know  you're H once so you've already made a  big splash with your new club signing  Leo Messi to enter Miami less than a  year after his World Cup win how would  you articulate the power a former player  like you has in talking to a current  star like Messi about such a major  career change there's only so far you  can go on the business talk and contract  talks I think player to player I think  it makes a huge difference and I came at  it as a player that had obviously moved  from Real Madrid to the LA Galaxy it's a  gift in the sense of I want to inspire  the next generation of young kids that  are playing in this country because at  some point the US will win the world cup  at some point and it needs moments like  this where you bring someone of Leo's  magnitude he's good on the field he's  good off the field he's the perfect  professional and so if you bring someone  like that then all of these young kids  that are watching throughout America  going to watch him in their stadiums in  their City get inspired and that's  really what we wanted to  [Music]  do has anyone picked them apart before  like this there's something about the  mechanics here that is new and novel to  me from the side of the table so one of  the things that strik about that free  kick against Greece is it almost looks  like you're celebrating it before the  ball hits the back of the net which is  something I'll see watching Steph Curry  play you know he'll celebrate a three  before it actually goes through the net  is there a way to describe the sensation  of knowing a strike is perfect right off  the boot well you're right in saying was  you celebrating before it went in  because I was and that's one of my  favorite things to have watched back for  the occasion for what it meant for the  country the moment I hit the ball I knew  it was in and you see me running away  which you've just obviously said about  um by the way my armpits are slightly  sweating already that's right a lot of  physiological arties as we work our way  through so so so the moment I hit it and  I I suppose I always describe it as a  golfer you know that moment where you  hit that sweet spot during that game I'd  had probably eight different free kicks  and it felt different from the rest I  didn't score many goals so I didn't get  that feeling very often but I got the  feeling of that I that I'd never ever  have again that moment poetic yeah  before we dive into the next sauce okay  should we crack open one of these  Stellas I mean it'd be rude not to all  right here we go  okay I'm trying to perfect this pore as  well I know well I heard you're good at  the pore well I'm not bad there was some  chatter about perfect  pores yours is pretty much right oh  that's a compliment coming from you  cheers  [Music]  David not a moment too soon yep I needed  that I watched Golden's one the other  night golden gon was very as we all know  gon's very animated anyway absolutely so  I knew he'd question obviously how  cooked the uh chicken is that is as much  anxiety as I've ever had going into a  shoot not thinking about how the  interview would go necessarily just how  Gordon might react to the wings wow  good on good on him what kinds of  culture shock did you experience when  you first entered the MLS back in 2007  when the league was still a work in  progress is it true that you would eat  Cheesecake Factory desserts for pregame  meals that's a funny story and that that  was the probably the biggest difference  when you're on the road you know as a  team you normally land on the Friday  afternoon you eat together on the Friday  night Saturday you have breakfast lunch  and then you play the game but when I  first came here we'd travel we'd go out  and you know we'd get pum so we'd  envelope cash yeah literally as we're  getting off the bus you'd get handed an  envelope and I'm like what's this and  I'd open it and I was like cash it was  like great and then the day of the game  I thought surely there's going to be  like a pre-match meal and there wasn't  so we were in I can't remember where we  were but we were in the middle of  nowhere and the only thing that was  there was the cheesecake Factory so I  literally went out the hotel all the  young kids had gone to McDonald's or  whatever and they'd saved their pum  whereas I kind of walked out and saw  Cheesecake Factory and that was my  pre-match meal which um yeah Sir Alex  Ferguson would have uh you quaked in his  boots at that uh  [Music]  yeah nice kind of a smokiness to this  one I'm not a big barbecue sauce fan but  this is nice I'm sure there are aches  and pains that uh all come from like a  cumulative effect of this 20 year long  career but I am curious is there a pain  that when you feel it tweak takes you  back to a very specific game or specific  moment I broke bones broke you know my  ribs and my hand and my foot and my toes  but I never really had a serious injury  other than rupture in my achilles um but  I suppose the worst pain that I  feel every single day is my back and I  know why because I think if you watch  the way I kick the ball I go at a  certain angle and I did that for 20  years 22 years so you know I read Andre  agy's book a few years back and I  remember him saying you know I knew you  know it was time to finish because I  used to roll out of bed you know because  I was in so much pain and I could I  could relate to that um so yeah I I  suppose my lower left side of my back  you know that's down to kicking the ball  the way I kicked it for 22 years the  consequences of bending It Like Beckham  apparently so I knew you'd get that one  in and how do you select each person is  it just a wish list we're always  pitching you know we're always chasing  an opportunity but now it is nice  because some of the requests are  incoming now which is a nice that's a  good problem that's a good problem to  have that's exactly right that didn't  that wasn't really that hot this one  enjoy these moments I know I know knew I  should never have said that don't fight  against your wins here in this game all  right all right do you have a most  cherished memory playing alongside or  against zadan who you've described as  one of your football heroes I was lucky  to have those years with him and there's  a couple of moments actually more than  the couple of moments that I cherish I  played him a ball in one game it was  about 60 yard ball and I was able to  just put it in front of him and he came  around and he scored this beautiful goal  with his left foot you know one of my  best assists in my career there's  another moment playing in his last game  you know his last ever game for Real  Madrid that was special because his  emotional side really come out and that  was that was special um but I think the  ultimate moment with me and zizu has to  be the last training session before his  last game I'm sat in the changing room  and he walks in and I'm sat there I'm  getting changed and he all of a sudden I  I see him out the corner of my eye  getting up up and he's walking towards  me and I'm like I start sweating like I  am now a little bit and zizu doesn't say  much you know he's a he's a man of you  know few words he sits down and he said  David I just want to say it's been a  pleasure playing with you for the last  few years and I was  like and literally he then went in to  get treatment and I jumped up I ran  outside I took my phone and I was like  couple of my mates I said you're never  going to guess what's just happened I  called my dad I was like Dad just said  this to me um so that has to be that has  to be the  moment this next one Oni ma actually  from  Spain  Spanish the  Spanish Spanish I was just about to say  the Spanish do things really well that  is a bit of a step up yeah yeah has that  deep pepper immediate I love Spain  though you know you don't have to wait  for it I love  Spain loving it a little less right  now I'm curious when you were watching  the Beckham documentary were there  moments in your life that were far  different from your recollection of them  once you saw the surrounding footage and  interviews with other people involved  you know for for instance in the 98  World Cup I hadn't seen a lot of the  footage I hadn't seen you know the  manager at the time come out and say  what he said so the first time I'd seen  it I'd never said saw one of our England  fans stood outside the pub saying yeah  we hung that noose up there and we took  the dummy down you know that was quite  shocking for me and there was so much  media hoopla that it only gets touched  down briefly you know the live studio  audience interview that you and Victoria  did with Ali G yeah do you remember how  you were prepped for that  um well I remember being sat backstage  in the green room with my wife  and my wife you know I wasn't used to  doing these kind of things so I was kind  she crushed it she crushed it even  better than you actually saw because  they cut a lot of their stuff out just  to make just to make you know him look  good uh and he looked great I remember  just going in and saying to Victoria I'm  going to let you talk I'm just going to  sit there and just take it what's the  origin story of the be honest meme  because I understand that fiser Stevens  tried everything in his power to keep  you guys separate well he was angry he  was angry with me you know Fisher I love  Fisher he apparently wanted me out the  house and this that particular day was  Victoria's first day of filming when she  was sat there the door was closed and  then I was about to leave for the office  but I made a coffee and then I saw a  spare set of headphones so I put the  headphones on and I heard Fisher talking  about you know the whole um you know our  parents and our upbringing and then all  of a sudden I heard I say you know we're  just we we're working class and that  moment I was like okay I headed to the  door I opened the door and I saw  Fisher's face and he was not happy and I  was like so that's really I was like be  honest the camera guys were so amazing  because they literally paned over to me  at the door um and that was really a  moment that uh yeah kind of kind of went  viral but Fisher was not happy Fisher  was really not happy  blackeyed  Susan and where's this one from has kind  of some late life this one's from  Maryland so this is like a slow burner  mhm literally yeah and that's what  you're probably going through now yeah  as you fight through it me the same  way that's not good did you have a  favorite chant to hear from fans you  know when Harry Kane was on the show he  said that the he's one of our own chant  that he would hear from Spurs fans was  very important to him the fans sing a  lot about you know old older players and  players from the past but I never seem  to hear it as much maybe maybe because I  don't go to many games but you know even  on the Telly I hear you know songs about  Eric cantar and Brian Robson and Roy  Keane from Manchester United fans but I  very rarely hear there's only one David  Beckham that was really the only chant  that I ever wanted to hear and I'd like  to hear it again if if any United fans  are watching please you know just from  time to time just from time to time you  know I'm I'm still still a United fan um  so yeah just every now and again just  you know there's only one David be  please I'm not excited about this  one yeah that's not  good and really does not taste good  either you know I had a conversation  with my mom last night and I said I'm  going on this TV  show  tomorrow so I'm going on this TV show  tomorrow said Gordon's been on it I said  have a look online see what you  think so she called me this morning on  the way so I went to watch's the the  team train this morning that is that is  not good I know yeah that is not good  um are these hotter the experience that  you're going through right now is a  singular experience this is an extremely  hot sauce  concentrated and pure she said  um please don't  swear she said I S gold held strong I've  held strong she said please don't square  square is it true that you once took  down 32 escargo while dining at Shaya M  Loui in Paris that's my record Lamy  Louie is my one of my favorite  restaurants in the world it's like 100  years old so when I was playing for PSG  I found this place and I used to go in  there on my own it used to open at 7:30  I used to go in there at 700 they used  to let me sit in the corner I'd feast  and then I'd leave because I couldn't  really be seen right eating the amount  that I was eating at the time while  still playing so I sat there with my  wife one night romantic meal  we ordered an amazing bottle of wine and  I'm sat there and I'm eating and eating  and she's just sat there like she  normally does when I feast and she's  like you need to stop you're going to  burst so I remember getting that the the  the best esar go but you know I've been  I've been so lucky because I I grew up  in the East End of London that's still  burning that one yeah I know forever  changes I grew up in the East End of  London jelly deals is it's a cut up ill  and it comes with  gelatine doesn't sound great you love it  but as an East End boy it's what I grew  up on and one of my favorite meals in  Manchester was chips peas and gravy so  just french fries mushy peas and gravy  when I moved to Madrid I all of a sudden  discovered you know the Spanish food and  that I absolutely loved so the hamon and  the angulas and the and the garlic you  know living in Spain  spending time and playing in Milan  living and playing in Paris Living in  America traveling to Asia a lot spending  a lot of time in China Japan all of  these places and I'm I eat anything I  really do case in point you know and in  those travels coming on to talk shows  where you expose yourself to the  wonderful world of hot sauce I'm not  sure this is a good as experience as um  Lamy Louie but you know you great memory  great memory actually it is a good  experience I like it I like challenging  [Music]  myself I must have touched the bottom of  my nose little hot spot on the face I've  been there before just be careful around  the eyes though that would be the worst  place worst place second worst place  okay what would you say is the most  impressive thing you've ever built with  Legos you're proud this moment as a Lego  Master my nose is on  fire my sinus is are great though yeah  right it's a little give and a little  take here you  um I don't know what my favorite Lego is  actually um I've done so many over the  years um I had the Manchester United I  had Old Trafford did the Old Trafford  Stadium um but I love Lego I care I love  Lego I just you know I love it what  makes SE you'll be there your favorite  Spice Girl song I remember being sat in  a hotel with Gary Neville who is my  teammate for Manchester United and my  best man at my wedding and we had a  game the next day and we're in the hotel  and we sat there watching the Telly and  all of a sudden the Spice Girls came on  with their new their new video and it  came on I think it was on top of the  pops  and uh it will say you be there I turned  around to Gary and I was like see the  one in the black dress see actually it  wasn't a black dress see the one in the  black cat suit I'm going to marry that  one and as you can imagine we were  laughing and joking and I was like no  I'm going to marry that one and uh and I  did so uh yeah imagine that but um we're  playing against  Chelsea and uh we're in the changer room  getting ready for for the game and one  of the players came in and he said uh  there's two Spice Girls here and I was  like what  ones and he was like sporty and uh and  Posh and I was like oh my God this is it  so I played the game I scored a goal a  great goal actually I scored a great  goal so I went up and I introduced  myself because the manager was a  Manchester United fan and I introduced  myself to Victoria and and then said  hello and I was there for 30 seconds cuz  I was I was quite embarrassed and then I  left got on the bus and I was like I've  missed my  opportunity um and then literally the  week after player comes and he says  they're  back same Spice Girls are here again um  and then that's really when I saw my  opportunity because I walked into the  Players Lounge and Victoria was there  and she'd had a couple of glasses of  wine and I was like okay okay here's my  opportunity to give me a number or get  her number so um yeah she uh she gave me  her number on a on a plane ticket and uh  I still have the plane ticket believe it  or not so um yeah that's how it all  started it's enough to bring a tear to  my eye and it's not even the wings  [Music]  David okay let me do that there you go  that's the smart way to do it okay  little bit of sweetness mhm  and and it grows but the good news is  David Beckham the wings of death they're  behind us you've conquered the gauntlet  and to close things out you know your  hairstyles they've inspired Trends  they've inspired lore and they've even  sparked some controversies so to close  things out what we're going to do is  pull up some of our favorite iconic  David Beckham hairstyles and you just  give us the first couple of things that  come to mind when you think about what  inspired these eras and we'll start with  the Mohawk impulsive or something that  was kind of in the works for a while it  actually wasn't impulsive because I'd  just done a photo shoot where I shaved  part of my hair off myself and then I  went into um I went into oh my  God I had a game at Wembley shortly  after and um and uh as I'm walking into  the Chang room I take my cap off and and  the boss is sat opposite me and he was  like go and shave it off he literally  got a pair of clippers for me and I had  to go and shave that off in the in the  in the  toilet um oh my God short lived  shortlived up next one that I'm partial  to the shaved head which you actually  called your favorite it's it was it's my  favorite because of the ease of a that's  the lifestyle accustomed to I could  never go back you know but but the  shocking the shocking well you could go  back you could go back no I can't yeah  you can the shocking part about this was  obviously I went from having this long  you know Cur you these these curtains  that I had uh to to that overnight and  uh yeah that was the shocking part of  this but he one of my best haircuts  favorite and one more for you the  ponytail yeah ponytail well I'm  surprised you you've not got the double  ponytail up there the the samurai the gy  um it was just long and that was the  only way of keeping it out my eyes for  the game practical cuz you know when you  talk about the curtains you know or like  the bangs it's practical actually to  pull everything back it's practical when  you're in a game of vision it's  practical yeah and look at you David  Beckham taking on the wings of death  living to tell the tail and proud of  myself nothing left to do but celebrate  with a Stella toast yes cheers oh my  God this camera this camera this camera  or this camera let the people know what  you have going on in your life well this  afternoon there's not much going to be  going on um but uh I want to thank you  Sean because

the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we're joined by Ryan Reynolds and  HW Jackman they're the stars of Deadpool  and Wolverine perhaps 2024's most  anticipated film bringing together these  iconic characters and Rivals has been  years in the making but the wait is  finally over Deadpool and Wolverine  opens in theaters Nationwide on July  26th Ryan Hugh welcome to the  show thank you very happy to be here  very what's sad is the film's so locked  that it's too late to have it start with  for  Hugh and Brian expired on a very popular  TV show yes I know that junkets they can  be a little bit of a grind it must be  surreal to be in front of this Gauntlet  of scorching hot wings what's your  mindset like going into this interview  thanks for using the word scorching  appreciate it y that was good because I  was a little nervous and now I feel  totally relaxed always wanted to mouth  sex a volcano so I'm going to do that  today just going to get my lips right  around it just let St Helen's release  her hot okay let's go let's move it on I  see where this is going  oh now you just come right in there  Sean that's perfect yeah yep I was  warned not to let it touch my lips it's  all over my lips it's everywhere like  like lip balm that was not a good  idea actually it's not bad it's okay  yeah we're good so Wolverine as a  character has so much gravitas I'm  curious at what point did you realize  his potential to be like the perfect  straight man in a double- act comedy the  moment I saw this is okay I'm doing all  right me too  okay um literally The Moment I Saw  Deadpool one that's where everything  came flushing to me that's where I saw  48 Hours nickn Eddie Murphy I saw  Midnight Run I Saw The Odd Couple I saw  Planes Trains automobiles I was like huh  these two characters have to be together  and I had literally announced my  retirement 3 days before yeah I was like  curses curses yeah um and anyway it took  us 6 years to get there but we got there  we got  there we're on to number two and my kids  thought I would literally be crying out  and nice little protein hit you know for  the guns I can't see  anything yeah well got a lot there all  right generous  bite so on a foundational level what's  it like for an actor to get fitted for a  superhero costume like how similar or  dissimilar is it to going to a tailor  and getting fitted for a custom soup  it's a great always the best questions  that's why I how you get them right  those are good questions um I'm starting  to feel by the way yeah don't go  there I'm just jumping a austr Off  Script y stay Australia keep up with the  Australia sherad yeah yeah right  the superhero suits are your biggest  calling card of the character of the  movie of everything the first time I put  on the suit I don't know if I've told  you this one cuz I I did the fitting in  newal 7 and 1/28 out of 10 it looked  incredible it was like great the first  time yeah it was uh it it had a little  bit of it still needed to be snugged  up make me look okay the second one  fitting I did it was like it was like  bang there's Wolverine and I haven't  taken it off for two years just sleeping  yeah it's just just an absolute sess the  moment we days after coella down there  um it's it's I do think that I I think  that the Deadpool suit and this  Wolverine suit are the two best comic  book movie suits ever made the Deadpool  suit is made by a guy Nam Rush Shankle  who who's just I think a genius and you  know knows how to kind of frame [ __ ] a  suit Forever Until It's just perfect um  and he really did yeah it's uh and this  this one yeah was just it was awesome  yeah  oh I like kimch out of Montreal for now  you like kimch but mhm okay well nailed  the lips there got all the lips okay  mhm so far so far we're okay see touch  the eyes do not touch my eyes I'm I'm  going to be watching you okay I'm not  going to let you do it Hugh yeah I'll  dive from across the table I'm going to  do this one there you go nothing wrong  with that y okay wow you didn't need to  do that I'm just going to say Korea no  true yep we  [Music]  Ry Ryan what was the worst accident or  harest situation you found yourself in  as a forklift driver at the Safeway on  25th in Oak in Vancouver are you getting  that you that kick at the back kick also  the the specificity there was a little  little alarming I haven't anything yeah  Ryan I've been living under your bed for  a year you tell a little bit about the  sounds you make when you're um but yeah  I Crush my ankle a couple of times on  those forklifts cuz they're the ones  that you drive and then you also have  the ones that you walk with but they're  motorized oh walking ones are the scary  ones things gets away from up oh yeah  and you back it up and you realize  you're standing like right next to an  industrial refrigerator and he just jams  you right into it you're like oh this is  how they find me yeah Hugh which  pre-fame job do you remember more fondly  and why working as a ranger for the  national parks Wildlife Foundation of  Australia or your time as a uh birthday  clown for hire which do you remember  more F my god um I remember more fondly  the birthday party Coco I lit literally  rented a clown outfit and me and this  guy Stan we went to birthday parties and  we had no skills literally no skills so  they robbed people and that's how they  did it they robbed everyone pretty much  I remember doing I broke my rule and I  did an 8-year-old party I was like I Bo  knew that was they're going to find me  out and he found me out and this kid  yelled to his mom mom this clown is  crap wow I was like shut up kid shut up  kid and one of my things was juggling I  could juggle so I had eggs and I was  like I just reached in I grabbed eggs  I'm like yeah well what are that and I  just cracked it on my head and he's like  that's funny so I just kept cracking and  then they just jumped on top of me and  that's it that was the last  time not the last time you would humil  at yourself for an  [Music]  8-year-old okay this is um some inhouse  product placement good eye for that  called hot ones and may I say that this  out of all of  the um really is one of the best hot  sauces that I think I've ever seen  before um you can order yours of course  online or at your local retailer but um  I feel more viral I feel like I can make  love like like Thor oh my gosh I could  um really this is the this is the one  Sean I don't feel safe no I get it but  I'm here for you H I'm here for you  thanks from a movie perspective I am  curious like when is a leak a good thing  and then when is it bad for the project  like what distinguishes that great  question uh really hard to to kind of  I'm shocked that we've managed to get  through this without some of our biggest  surprises uh ending up even being  hypothesized on online but man it's hard  to keep a secret you know I I I'll say  I've never talked about this before but  do you know that maybe you know this the  original idea with this movie was to  shoot a fake  movie uh called Alpha cop that was  intentionally bad like the poster I even  had one of the posters made it was it  was about two guys who are sharing one  brain and it and together they make the  ultimate cop and the poster says you  know Alpha cop two two cops one brain  all balls and um it was meant to be kind  of like horrible and you know so you  would go you you know like 10 people in  America would go to see this movie on  opening weekend and 5 minutes into the  movie the Marvel logo would flip up and  it would actually be um thatp  Wolverine D but the problem with if you  manag to get right down to the last  minute and it gets blown you know it  would just it would' be heartbreaking so  I don't know it's but we've been lucky  on this one some would be unfortunate  for the people that really wanted to see  Alpha cop too you know you got to think  about them that's true which may or may  not be rolling 5 minutes into our movie  on July 2 not see that coming um yeah I  can give you an example of bad League  X-Men Origins Wolverine when I think a  week before the whole movie was somehow  leaked online in fact I think it's the  only case where someone's been  prosecuted and gone to jail for the leak  oh wow yeah I remember it was a rough  rough it was like it was rough rough and  it was leaked maybe a week before we  came out and I think I just remember  someone saying I think it's up to 10  million people have seen it already  before we'd come out yeah no that's  that's completely crazy a bad leak yeah  the leak that leak had a higher Rotten  Tomato score which was shocking given  that it was you know blue screens and  ropes and that was the hardest part they  shouldn't have reviewed that that's not  [Music]  fair this is Fat Cat uh yeah fat cat  which isn't nearly as good as hot Ones  hot sauce available at any of your local  retailers I took to Big a bite I took to  Big a bite M oh that was a rookie eror I  think it was rud that said Paul rud of  just dropping that name there um said  watch out for five yep that's a step up  I'm going for the milk already I'm in  I'm starting I'm man enough for a minute  can you each reveal what you estimate to  be the most takes ever requested by a  director for a single scene of a movie  you in I remember on X-Men one it wasn't  it wasn't I was in the same B it was  Patrick Stewart having to give a long  bit of mutation you  know Exposition  done I remember there was 30 there was  in the 30s for that and it was a long  bit of thing yeah I fell for him there  it's the it's a hot sauce I'm not  laughing so I cry because of him okay I  hate that we put all that hot sauce  on stop no Hugh no I'm not kidding why  did you do that I don't know why I did  [Music]  that on okay on ma on M see what  you don't know why I double dip there  tastes angry it's really angry it does  you know what I'm going to eat I'm going  to eat a bag of Rusty razors that's what  I'm going to eat you know walls starting  to close in that's yeah the walls are  they're the walls yeah um really Oni ma  very intense again nowhere near hot that  was a that was a significant jump off  that a signicant play around anymore  we're in the back half so when you hear  about movies taking an inordinate amount  of time to make you know like Deadpool  taking a decade to get off the ground or  Kevin Cosner's Horizon taking 30 years  what is actually happening behind the  scenes and then what are the sorts of  things that can get these projects over  the home what are some of the things  cheating you know you know if you have  test footage some [ __ ] just leaks it  on the internet yeah that was SM turns  it into a big old [ __ ] glory hole in  a piranha tank everybody just taking a  whack  uh I'm just saying words now that's  [ __ ] me up yeah that's [ __ ] me up  too yeah tears are coming tear are good  I mean real men cry real men cry exactly  right this will all be lost like tears  in the rain ruer Hower blade that's it  why are you zooming in stop  zooming

Starlet this is important  important write a passage your next role  is going to be amazing uh the I think  that the enemy of of of quality can very  much be uh too much time and money and  um I mean some big movies I mean [ __ ]  right this is [ __ ] wild uh some films  that I've been on are they have a lot of  money and you kind of keep throwing more  money at a problem when you kind of your  real problem is that you are focused on  spectacle over character I'm trying to  speak really quickly because God damn it  no I get it I get it and uh yeah when  you focus on spectacles as opposed to  character audiences I think are a little  inured to spectacle I feel like the CGI  effects and those kinds of things aren't  what actually sustain an audience after  a movie comes out that they in fact uh  relate to and remember character moments  that remember a line or a moment more so  than they will the Earth being in Peril  or or something like that so um yeah I  uh I actually it's the first time in my  life I don't know if I'm peeing  [Music]  you edit that out hold on yeah we're  there I'm actually shaking yeah yeah I  think my I'd like I'm going to test my  heart rate after this

has better food and then you'll vote  with the paddle and if there's a  disagreement it maybe would be nice to  debate it in real time but I understand  that's a lot to throw at you especially  given the circumstances and then we're  going to bring in some ice cream for you  guys too ice here comes some ice cream  oh thank you Victoria I I may have  reached my limit I really may have reach  my

__ ] right I think you're incapable I am  is all right yeah that's great that's  great now not fun not fun I'm looking  down the barrel like like there's a God  in there I see that is there a god in  there  oh my God I I I cheat at Wordle I don't  know why I just said that  cheated terrible bit up the back of my  nose I  know you how does the pressure of  singing the National Anthem at a rugby  match between Australia and New Zealand  how does that compare to say like  hosting  tonies or waiting for the opening  weekend box office numbers to roll in  like does one induce more Panic than the  others yeah singing the National Anthem  for the first time when you don't  identify as a singer at the time and  realizing you're in front of 990,000  people in a stadium that will boo you  your own country people will boo you I  was so scared and I was you were so  scared that you said sure why not  totally I said sure I'll do it and I  remember being in the dressing room  which is where the players like smells  of like d and I just was singing the  National Anthem over and over again  austr just like to get through the  nerves and there was an old guy sitting  in the corner who's job is to clean it  up and he goes ah you bit to bit toy  over there are you mate which means  nervous you bit n bit nervous I said  well yeah you know there's only 990,000  people he goes I forget that there's  like a like a billion people watching on  TV that I have never been more scared in  my life that that was the most actually  it helped me because everything hosting  the Oscars opening weekend anything  nothing has been as scary as that EA in  the world's spest chicken I have not  been this nervous in a while and that's  why I'm just talking I'm just talking to  distract myself can I have a tissue why  are you shaking it up what are you doing  don't worry I'll get  it s this is a real friendship uh except  till  [Music]  now I might put de bomb down just to  like finish inside an ambulance oh D get  back there we've got through that we've  climbed man I want to put down the  delicious hot  on course available at any of your  natural online  retailers stores I may go with um

bomb  crossover the skin the skin is the  problem what I want make evidence of the  bomb there okay what a way to go and  then you got some questions for us Sean  right yeah I got one last question  cheers okay there it is remember how it  grows right you know it sort of um  flowers  into  something it's like there we go turned  the shake is turned into a little bit of  a celebratory dance oh oh with no no  you're remember it's like a good hour  before that joyful a [ __ ] I can take  an optimistic man right now War crime in  a bottle and it becomes worse and worse  is right I have a headache I have a  headache so on the screen you guys have  fostered this rivalry this antipathy  towards one another but as we've seen  today we know that the real relationship  it's rooted in love it's rooted in  respect so to close things out I'm  curious after doing this film together  what's one thing that you appreciate  about the other more than ever what's  one thing that annoys you about the  other more than say it's the most um uh  uh unromantic thing but for somebody who  tends to I tend to over function a bit  right like I tend to um I think anxiety  takes me to a place where I sort of over  prepare over function overbook myself  all of those things working with anyone  who is is  conscientious when we are together  outside of our public Persona taking the  piss out of each other other most of our  conversation are very vulnerable and  kind of um um I will re reenact this  whole thing with crude sock puppets to  my  therapist this whole um Hugh why don't  you talk about  me thank you I can see my breath and  it's warm in here stop  B Brian is 47 sorry sorry  internet sorry cute I know internet you  say you've got a ride but he is not a  little farther  than in love great

anything  else you are clearly having a problem  over I'm not doing well um things are  not going well over here um this is a  wild card  where did that come from this scary a  little bit holy [ __ ] I feel like I'm in  a David Lynch movie or something okay  Despicable Me 4 is about to take the  animation World by storm test your  artistic abilities by drawing a portrait  of your opponent first person to laugh  must eat a  Deathwing are you going to try to be  good like what's the vibe I can't be  good even if I wanted to are you good at  drawing no I don't even know how to draw  like you've got a half up style going I  don't know how to draw that you don't  have a forehead currently and that is  not it's not what Instagram says  Instagram says I've got a massive  forehead and I happen to agree with them  I'm trying to get really nice cheekbones  the more I'm studying your face for this  this does not represent you in any way I  promise this is not what I think about  you this is not what I think of you at  all in anyway are you ready  [Music]  yeah I love  mine do you forget the challenge oh wait  wait what you're supposed to not laugh  oh God I completely I was not thinking  about it the spice makes my mind go off  and  nothing oh I'm so sorry I had no chance  anyway this is what the hell is that  like I was scariest thing I've ever seen  so mean you look like the Annabelle doll  or something it looks exactly like cute  looks nothing like me but that's cute  and I'm so sorry but you have to you  know oh man Wing I'm scared of that one  because it's the bigest like yeah oh see  that's why you went on the outer edges  mhm I was afraid you're taking another  bite no no I can't actually am I I don't  know you turned it around oh okay I mean  you are shocking that's surprising I'm  not good at the challenges I can't  remember the  rules I feel so bad all right are you  ready I think so you have appeared in  two Taylor Swift music videos that's so  cool and

Wing fine like that's an insane  question what kind of a person would  answer that  question all  right getting a little cold now it's a  same I'm trying to get like neutral air  I want to just be like like it's like  neutral air is what I'm that's actually  the best thing but breathing out is the  worst thing it hurts we okay spaghetti  taco  roulette I Carly fans will remember the  groundbreaking culinary creation that is  spaghetti tacos I do one of the tacos in  front of you is spicy two are not choose  correctly and you're safe choose  incorrectly and you suffer the Wrath of  the last dab I don't know if I can take  any more  spice you pick one I pick one when  should we pick one okay we should pick  one on the count of three so it's fair  we'll point to it sounds good

okay that was a spicy taco I think  the taco is spicier and worse than the I  don't even know what I don't know  actually at this point everything's the  same kind of the same the spaghetti  tacos were just something that the  came up with and we ate them in one  episode and then people just kept  talking about them and making them and I  tried spaghetti tacos because of my  tried them before yeah because of I you  like them or did you yes what's not to  like it's carbs on  carbs it's tradition around here to put  a little extra on the last Wing yeah you  and your Appo  appointment your  app I give  up you and your opponent can add an  extra dab to your final wings now this  is the last dab they're all the last dab  tradition is to shake  it and then open  it I'm going to I'm going to

and  today we're joined by Benny Blanco and  Selena Gomez they have a brand new  collaborative album on the way it's  called I said I love you first and it's  due out March 21st check out the single  scared of loving you and call me when  you break up featuring Gracie Abrams but  in the meantime it's an early dinner  with the wings of death Selena Benny  welcome to the show thank you I'm so  excited it's like a perfume of like  Scotch bonnets in my nose what's your  mindset like going into this do you feel  on the same wavelength that he's  competitive I'm probably going to win uh  I I'm I'm a shell of a human already I'm  scared  [Music]  is it crazy to use a fork it is a little  crazy to use a fork but I'm not going to  stop you it's crazy no one would ever do  that right I I feel like I whoa we just  go in let just go  in delicious  I need Ranch oh yeah there's ranch right  here you ask and you shall receive babe  don't worry thanks son you want a little  ranch so I'm curious what it's like to  make a pop record with someone who you  have a deep relationship with did that  kind of unique collaboration add any  layers to the music that took you by  surprise I mean for me personally for  sure I was able to tell him things that  I don't think I would in um another  relationship because he was  also to me like the conductor of of this  record and I don't know I felt like I  could tell him things that maybe I was  feeling um insecure about that I  wouldn't feel like I could open up to  any other producer that way let alone  like a  partner that was a good answer that was  a good answer um no it was like when you  work with people like sometimes you butt  heads and I feel like every time one of  us had like a discrepancy on something  the other one was like h okay yeah  that's that's chill and we also got to  make it like in our house in our bedroom  like it it just felt low  steaks oh my God that was good not a  problem oh this one's got like a nice  little like late life on it yeah it's  like a like it's like just a little kiss  good night yeah I don't mind this that  bab little tie green chili kiss yeah so  Selena I want to take a wing to unpack  that fateful day in 2019 when we did hot  ones on The Tonight Show and you were  blindsided by the bomb Beyond Insanity  what do you remember like sort of a  play-by-play way I remember not liking  you after that I remember being very  upset I'm just kidding no it was  actually it was hysterical because I I  didn't know what to expect and I love to  do a challenge so I was like maybe it'll  be like TV hot so it'll be fine and when  when it happened and my face started to  melt and I was using this to scrape it  off my tongue thinking that would work  um I was just really all I remember is  being in a lot of pain that's why I was  nervous to come back she was very  nervous like leading up to it she was  like when we were on the way she's like  I don't even want to talk about it and I  was like what I was like are you like  nervous are you like excited she was  like don't talk to me I'm like I'm going  to do this I now I know what it is I  just think when you're about to do an  interview sometimes when you're sweating  I just look back yeah and you just trust  Jimmy right to do like a viral segment  and then here comes the hot Ones guy  with the bomb Beyond Insanity you went  only de bomb well on the talk show it's  not this like 10 wi workup it's just a  straight vertical ring you just just  full jump off of an airplane that was  like the third wing that we did don't  remind me yeah let's just move forward  on this now what's this so up next is a  pickled garlic Sriracha oh interesting  thing oh I like this  [Music]  one I could do 12 of these just like on  the game de I don't even watch on the  game day on The Game Day game day Benny  yeah on the game day I could totally  yeah just's like a game day type of guy  now I just eat  wings I like this one you like that one  yeah I actually do do you have a food  hot take for 2025 or a dining Trend  that's driving you nuts you don't have  to have the pan be automatically as hot  as it can be I don't understand when  people start cooking like the pan is  always like full blast like you can cook  it slower it's like okay and like people  are always touching it too much like if  they're like cooking a steak cooking  chicken cooking fish they're like every  3 seconds they're like moving it  touching just like Let It Be You know  what I thought you were going to say  what is when you're always doing  something dangerous with a knife I  always try to hug you in the oh yeah she  always whenever it's the most dangerous  thing in the kitchen I I'll be like  frying like a like like an entire  Lobster and she like comes up and like  tickles me like it's like whatever  whatever no it's like whatever is the  the like the worst thing I I just happen  to pick those time yeah every time  yeah okay I don't know why I like to  smell them before I try it has the kick  after yeah like I remember when I did  this last I'm at four in feeling this oh  yeah this one what how how far are we  we're at number four oh wow out of a lot  huh okay cool yeah all  right Benny can you unpack what you mean  when you say that pop songs are like a  DJ set crammed into 3 minutes that's fun  if you went into a [ __ ] club and like  from the second you went to the club was  just like and there was never any break  like you'd have like a heart attack but  if there's like you know there's that  second where like everyone's like the  annoying people with the little gloves  are going like this and it's like and  there's like [ __ ] people are hanging and  like drugs are hitting where you at I  don't know you know what I'm talking  about I feel you you know what I'm  talking about things are happening drugs  are hitting your and then all of a  sudden they bring you up to the drop  again it's like that's that's where you  want a song to be you want it to have  Dynamics apparently that's what a song  about go Mike drop what's something that  artists and producers obsess over in the  studio that the general music listening  public either doesn't notice or doesn't  care about we talked about this last  night um you know we'll work for so long  on like the sound of like a snare drum  and I remember I called my mom and I  said hey Mom have you ever noticed like  different snare drums in different songs  and the first thing she said to me is  what's a snare drum and I was like you  know it's like the thing that happened  and she said I thought all of them were  were the same and I said what about the  kick and she said what's the kick like  my mom looks at music as it's like one  whole blob like it to her it's just like  there's music and then there's the AC  cappella and there's nothing else it's  just those two elements and meanwhile  there's like 75 elements within that and  I think though if you start to take  those away it like makes a song less  exciting people can feel it they may not  be able to describe it but they can feel  it this does not sound sweet  I take it back this is a little  [Music]  sweet got kind of  a oh W this one summer sauce vibe to it  yeah I like when you start going like  this well get used to it it's getting  hot do you want a little  napkin are oh you okay perfect just  making sure yeah I see that what's at  the center of the ven diagram of your  musical tastes and then I'm curious on  the other sides if there are genres that  you reserve for a lone time no I play  him everything even if it annoys him um  I love when I'm alone maybe sometimes I  get a little  emo um or in the car for some reason in  the car I can get really emo I feel like  our intersection is like paty Klein and  like Ella Fitzgerald yeah that's like  that's fair and then she did get me into  I I I honestly didn't know before we  started dating like obviously I was  aware of like Taylor Swift's music but I  didn't I I wasn't like a true Swifty  until I was no I didn't know and now I'm  like now I'm like I'll be like put that  song on how's that one go again and like  we're in the car and I'm like wow I'm  just like singing Taylor Swift songs  from like 10 years ago and I'm like feel  free Timeless what can I say well Selena  you know where else you've been a very  positive influence he's a much more  manageable talk show guest now than he  used to be I like that I like that it's  noticeable yeah  growing  [Music]  up what's this one called This is  volcano oh great love the name you asked  I I'm not I'm not sure if I like the  thing that it's doing it just like keeps  expanding deeper in my throat that's  kind of the trajectory that we're on  going forward oh so now it's like about  to be like really bad but you know what  we are six down we're into the back half  let's celebrate the progress you once  said that if you try to write a hit that  it never works out I'm curious what's  the most surprised you've been by a  record  success to be honest I haven't had like  a like really any number ones so I don't  really think I've ever cared until L you  to love me I thought the song was going  to be hopefully relatable and beautiful  and honest but I did not expect it to do  what it did um and it was much bigger  than me had nothing to do with what it  actually meant it ended up being being a  song for people that felt the way that  I've felt and and maybe turned it into  another version of a song that that  suited them it was really powerful to me  and I think that's something I'll always  remember and I believe that was my first  number one so I was very happy oh [ __ ]  her answer is so  [Music]  good okay I'm here for it let do it okay  this ISS crazy hot  now it has kind of like a freshness yeah  like vegetable kind of vibe up front no  I like this one and then there's some  action you know later mhm I'm feeling it  I'm feeling that you feel the action  it's like so far back how' I didn't even  know my throat went that far back like I  feel it so down I just I also I like um  I don't really like the flavor so the  combination SP and the flavor I'm really  confused she's confused Selena is there  an old man tendency you've picked up  secondhand spending so much time with  Martin Short and Steve Martin I don't  know I sit there and read the news with  them every day uh we talk about don't  they eat the same thing every day and  they eat the same thing every day and  now I eat the same thing every day it's  D it's either a Tuda sandwich with a  Dijon  mustard or sushi and now all I eat is a  chicken salad sandwich and for some  reason I'm excited to get my meal next  to theirs uh I feel like my Lego is  pretty you know I'll say yes a little  bit sometimes I'll say yes no and I I  remember as whilst I was um it's like  who am I what am I talking about but  that's just that's Steve and Marty I  don't know they're the best all right  try to keep I blacked out about two  minutes ago I'm just staring this thing  in the face right and we're in this  black curtain void this is De bomb  Beyond Insanity oh cool I'm giving you a  warning this time SEL don't smell it  don't smell it I know I shouldn't okay  and now what do we do do we dip it do we  no I I just sniffed it and this is so  bad oh good what do I do what should I  do just bite it just rip it I was going  to say what do you mean what do you  [Music]  do  I'm all  right holy  [ __ ] I don't even This Is What You Did  Last I can't I'm not even here anymore  wow it's getting worse yeah and it kind  of will does it ever no [ __ ] yeah but  the good news is we're on the other side  of it all right the rest of the show  it's downhill from  here I know I know oh wow I  know and on this Wing what we want to do  is dust off an old hot ones classic so  this right here is a bucket of questions  it could be multi purpose hold  on so if you guys take that so here's  how this works is if you reach in there  you pull out a question and it's a  question that you'll ask to Benny and  then you'll pass the bucket and then  Benny you'll pull a question ask to  Selena I hate you so I know I know I get  it I get it I understand  [Music]  too it's like should my songs not  including the ones we've made together  is your alltime  favorite um my brain is just going it  just keeps going you answer the damn  question well answer it um  uh good for  you wow it's like it doesn't go away huh  no I have to stand up yeah go ahead take  a lap take a  lap why why do people do this if you  could kill Sean how would you do it what  um no it's it says what would you say my  most underrated song  is you don't even know my song what what  just came out of your nose what was that  it was way  about do you want some ice cream do you  want some ice cream ice cream ice cream  helps no you're good God I'm such a  little baby did you have any of the  pepid I had Pepsi before I came up I  don't know I I don't know what song you  would have done I'm sorry  babe I just get no answer all right  cool yeah don't worry oh you're songs  are amazing Benny pull another you can  pull another one oh just ask her another  question yeah  oh I also I don't think I care about  anything if you if I were  a it's crazy you like lose motor skills  um if if I were a wild animal what kind  of animal would I  be monkey or koala  bear it's honestly the two I was  thinking I swear to God  if you're ready we can move on please  okay so this is the Sicilian scorpion  what is this one hotter not as bad as  the last  one the key that I realize is you don't  let it touch your lips  mhm oh [ __ ] I touched my lip a little  bit just a  teeny do you

      "page_content": "nothing can be hotter than that and  still  legal hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings today  we're joined by Rob mckel honey you know  him as Mack on the FX comedy series It's  Always Sunny in Philadelphia which is  set to return for its 17th season later  this year keep up with him on his Emmy  award-winning Sports documentary series  welcome to and he also co-created and  stars in the Apple TV plus comedy series  Mythic quest with season 4 out right now  Rob welcome to the show thank you for  having me I'm a big fan what's going  through your head as you prepared to  take on these spicy wings in front of  you are you a hot sauce fan um I like  when I can taste things not necessarily  feel the pain um and I've watched many  episodes of the show so I know what I'm  in for but I have a feeling I don't  really know what I'm in for until we get  there  my right side senior luga  okay we just take a bite then we  talk that's the  [Music]  [Laughter]  concept I had a sweater on M I realized  no no sweater is not going to work  you're I mean I saw you sweating right  through  it I noticed you're wearing a jacket and  I'm wondering if that's because of are  you actually chilly or are you hiding  something I think you look nice you look  great I'm just wondering you look great  I love this Polo by the way I'm kind of  a polo guy too so when I see one that I  like I don't pick out any of my own  clothing I have a wonderful wonderful  person that does that name Laria and  she'll be happy to be saidia is doing a  great job thank you so I heard you say  that it took all of 30 minutes hanging  out at the Ubisoft video game Studio to  realize its potential as a workplace  comedy what are the things that you  observed that made you think this is a  great setting and inspiration for a show  like Mythic Quest I within 10 minutes of  walking around I realized we had a show  because I realized the video games had  nothing to do with it it was a workplace  comedy I watched people with big Egos  and big ideas and executors and the  people who just had to run the office  human resources and realize oh wow it's  just another take on a workplace comedy  so that's what we went  with I'm ready to  go  okay come on there we go when do we  start when do we start I feel like I'm  going to  have one of those Shack moments which I  think is one of my favorite moments of  the series where he's talking [ __ ] and  then all of a sudden sudden he just  stops and looks directly into frame when  he realizes he got got he uh and I'm  wondering which one of these is going to  get me got he apologizes to Kansas I  apologize Kansas holy I know I was  actually thinking about Kansas cuz I  know that's where the bomb you know too  much ra you know too much I do my  research I want to do a good job so it's  always sunny is entering its 20th year  making it the longest running sitcom in  American TV history do you have any  foundational tips for preserving a  creative partnership or striking that  balance between ambition and  sustainability yes it's uh just like any  uh longterm relationship in your life  whether it's platonic romantic  professional you got to communicate and  you have to be able to uh resolve  conflict because there's three of us  with that particular show early on we  realized let's just Institute a rule of  two against one and it's really really  and I know it sounds silly and simple  but it has been profound  the the assumption is do you trust me  yes do I trust you yes and the three of  us trust each other and we trust our  taste so therefore if two of us feel  strongly about something then the other  one has to capitulate no matter what no  questions asked they get a chance to  plead their case and we all have to  remain  open-minded but if the two of us still  or two of them say nope this is the way  we're going you move on quickly and it  actually diffuses so many problems so  quickly because you don't have time time  as you all know you work in production  it's so expensive to run these shows you  just don't have time to negotiate every  single thing and you got to move fast  and that has saved us I mean that has  saved us hours I would actually say that  that saved years of Our Lives  [Music]  emotionally  pickled uh very  conscious of talking while I eat but  that's also the show that's yeah even  just taking a bite but I realized I just  watched a movie the other night my kids  never seen Oceans 11 so we watch Oceans  11 and Brad Pit is eating through the  entire [ __ ]  movie I'm serious you think and like At  first you're like oh well you know Brad  Pit's like kind of a cliche that he eats  in every one of his movies he's eating  in every scene of the movie so I don't  know if you can get the rights to show  clips from it but whatever it's the  internet's the world Wild West go back  and watch it every scene as an actor you  know that too if he's eating like one  sandwich in a scene he's actually eating  like six sandwiches that day that's the  thing he's not spitting it well he's got  to spit out most of it I don't know but  either way he makes it work so why so  why can't you so why can't you as I was  talking about comparing myself to Brad  Pit eating is you I just spit [ __ ]  chicken all over the all over the table  let's slow-mo that  okay  sorry so why can't  you I feel like you're going to [ __ ] me  at some  point  no do you ever rate  the you get it a little bit I get it a  little bit now now I see where  it's so you once said I feel like it's a  dangerous and dark world if Sunny  becomes mainstream comedy can you  unpackage that I think that satire just  by Nature needs to be somewhat  counterculture otherwise it would be  culture and if it's culture then it  would be taken at face value and if it's  taken at face value then it's no longer  satire and then you can't do the things  that we do on Sunny we're starzing  hypocrisy and culture and I don't think  we get it right 100% of the time in fact  if you do then you're probably not  pushing as far as you need to so we're  always right out on the edges and on the  fringes some would say of good taste um  and they're right and some would say of  like you know correctness or whether you  know whether  it's fair to even look at a show from  2007 or 2008 and judge it by the same  standards um as as we do today I think  the vast majority of the people that  watch what we're what we do understand  what our intent was at the time  halfway mark  really I mean come on this the I love  this part I I feel like this is a  [Music]  prank this is the part where everyone's  like I thought this show was going to be  hard I thought it was going to be and  then it comes it drops what do you think  is the most underrated Regional food  specialty in Philly I'm so glad that you  asked this question question and framed  it the way that you did because usually  you get people saying what's your  favorite cheese steak where do you go to  get your favorite cheese steak uh or  soft pretzels possibly and it's almost  like I mean we Philadelphia is the  birthplace of our nation and we've been  reduced to uh the purveyors of diced  meat on rolls as like our our Touchstone  let's stay positive okay there's  something called a Tasty Cake and they  basically like donuts they have jelly  ones they're like a grape jelly which is  definitely not jelly it is some sort of  labade delicious sugar but it hits but  it  hits well speaking of delicious treats  are you ready to move on here to Sauce  number six yeah I feel like this is  where it's going to go okay yeah so this  one right here is called Volcano here in  the six  spot okay  and there's a  [Music]  cat and if cat's breathing fire or  puking right this is not that's a bone  that's me releasing a bone that's cuz  you're going in you're going in Rob I'm  trying to I want to do it  right  um yeah that's getting  there that's roasted habanero yeah yeah  we're summering here a little bit set  but it's getting fun it's getting fun  baby okay so do you think being a  Creator showrunner writer do you think  that's made you an easier actor to work  with or do you think it's created a  monster that has to pop the hood on  everything that comes to their trailer a  little bit of both I think what what  it's definitely made me um and I Kate  Caitlyn really has um curbed this with  me I'm not a great person to watch stuff  with I think sometimes because I'm  always I'm not trying to ruin things I'm  trying to figure out how and why people  made certain decisions you do this for  long enough and you realize like oh that  would be the most effective way to  manipulate this situation or tell this  story and I wouldn't consider myself an  actor first um and I think anybody who's  ever seen anything that I've acted in  would agree uh I think I'm a a writer  first and  so the really great actors um the ones  that can just be so vulnerable and open  themselves up and be weird and be okay  with like it takes a special breed to be  like a really really amazingly effective  actor and so I have so much compassion  for them and I love them and and uh and  there's always a a certain way you have  to approach things with  them I know it's coming when's it going  to hit though  you need more than seven spots for me oh  there we  go where's the eighth  spot up  next yeah no okay  yeah I get it I get it now I [ __ ] get  it and too you know like sometimes  they're a little late you know like you  I know go a couple bites you think it's  fine and then it turns up the volume  volum on you you  know  yeah yeah I know what you're talking  about we got a whole episode of Sunny  this year where we  um um where we try we treat hot sauce  like it's uh Like Cocaine where we start  doing enough hot sauce and it gives  gives us that Endor endorphin rush which  does happen by the way so we thought  that'd be really fun and funny and so we  track as we get more and more addicted  to the hotter sauces using the  scullville meter which we stole stole  from you obviously um but um I think  you'll appreciate that episode I'm I'm  resisting this for as long as possible  but like I'm never going to tap out I'm  going to see it through  but my kid was like don't drink the milk  and so I'm doing easy for him to say I  know I'm doing this for him he didn't  say anything about the water but he said  don't drink the milk but how does being  an owner make you any more or less  sympathetic to American sport owners in  general how does that shift your  perspective like does it make you like  more sympathetic to that yeah it's you  know look teams are going to go up and  down and up and down and up and down but  then you have these organizations that  maybe even when they go down they only  go down for a couple years and then they  come back up and then you have other  organizations that just sort of are  middling for so long or maybe always at  the bottom and I always feel so bad for  the for the fan bases more than anything  else because they deserve something  better but it and it has to be it has to  come from the top at at a certain point  like 5 years sure 10 years I don't know  15 20 years of a lack of success that's  those are my teams yeah I know I mean  the Bears are that's tough man like I  the the football is better when the  Bears are good I'm always straddling and  I have been since the beginning of Sunny  both being management and on the  workforce I'm in charge of the budget  but I'm also negotiating against myself  when we're you know when we're putting  together lighting pack and things like  that and so I always no matter what will  always tilt towards labor um or artists  always um so it's it's hard to feel  sorry for the owners cuz you know kind  of [ __ ] them I feel bad for and so I  feel bad for the fan base is number one  and then I will always tilt towards the  players more than the owners that makes  sense you got to be careful about saying  that because then the players that Rex  them are like okay boss write to jck  we only got three  left look at that looking right down the  [Music]  barrel it's hard to swallow that's tough  yeah okay well I thought we would get  thought we would get here if I'm being  honest ah [ __ ]  yeah I thought we would get  here earlier yeah so I'm happy about  that but there's not much else to be  happy about in a moment like  this that sucks yeah yeah and it's not  going to get any easier no that's just  me being radically transparent as a talk  show post yeah that's yeah take a lap  yeah walk it  out here we go yeah just find that  Zen is someone who grew up shaped and  inspired by  shows like family ties and watching  Golden Girls at your mom's house on the  weekends I'm curious what's your Mount  Rush more of sitcoms you're top four of  all time  wow Seinfeld cuz I never seen anything  like that  before  uh um British office cuz I never seen  anything like that  before woo I'm going to  say  friends I think  friends cuz you never seen anything like  that before uh no I've seen lots of that  stuff like I seen lots of things like  that before but never executed that well  and was a big inspiration for sunny  oddly and Family Ties because Michael J  fox was my  idol nothing can be hotter than that and  still  legal well when does it stop in like 15  or 20 minutes this will all be just a  memory you know and you'll be like I  could do that again it won't be a memory  it be it'll be a television  show this is called Sicilian scorpion I  will say you've been throwing down on  the wings and you haven't had any water  or milk this entire time no but I  noticed you haven't  either I know you know what I'm taking  my cues from you well I take them from  you so we're in a  standoff take off your jacket okay  I feel we're dressed similarly we are  yeah yeah that's what we needed let me  tell you more about the trials and  tribulations of being a  celebrity these are the trials and  tribulations of being a celebr right  [Music]  here [ __ ] you yeah there we go I feel  like I'm cursing too much and my my  mom's going to be upset Long Leash on  this show okay  which stung worse having your Deadpool  Cameo cut or being cut out of your  acting debut in the 1997 film The Devil  Zone not even close by a country mile  getting caught out of the devil Zone  that was one of the most humiliating and  terrible experiences of my life because  it was my first job my first acting job  in a movie I got to do a scene with  Harrison Ford I got to do a scene with  Brad Pit I got to see do a scene with uh  um Jesus Christ uh with Julia Styles  Ruben blades all these incredible actors  so it was like four or five different  scenes then the movie's coming out and I  notice I don't get an invite to the  premiere or the friends and family  screening and but I'm I'm still just  starting out I'm like 19 or something 18  and I'm thinking I know it'll be fine so  I tell of course for a year I'm telling  everybody I got this movie nobody  believes me cuz I hadn't worked at all  doing anything else and then we go to  the movie all my friends everybody my  family buys tickets and I'm just not in  it at all they cut me completely out of  the movie didn't give me a heads up  nothing they were all a  players and I was a d player on the  ground I wasn't even a player I was on  the edior floor editing room floor yeah  what else you got look at you now  [Music]  I'll let you dab me I'd be  honored I trust you there you go I don't  know why I trust you but I trust  you okay here we go let's go let's go  what do we cheers let cheers all right  Fu it [ __ ]  it there we go  what a  [Music]  run okay  AMA let's go and the good news is the  wings of death are behind us just one  more question for you you know now this  is actually for my  son so that I can say to him if I may  directly into frame go ahead I beat you  and I'm still the alpha of this family  now I not a large man and you will be a  large man because the genetics through  your mom's line but I will take  you I will take you for at least the  next 10 to 15 years let them know let  them know all right so to close things  out Rob there's somebody with the  mightest touch who's bridged  entertainment the business of Hollywood  as well as anyone but I'm curious as a  showrunner and a media entertainment  Visionary do you have a note for us do  you have a note for this show and feel  no impulse to hold back back we have  very thick skin here one of the things  that we we desperately search for in the  entertainment industry is the hook that  gets people in but then that hook also  winds up becoming a liability because  then you have to play to it and Pander  to it on a consistent basis and then you  can't let character come through I  believe you've transcended that I think  you've got the hook that gets people  excited um and they want to check it out  but then the reason it works is because  you are so good at what you do I I say  as I blow snot out of my  nose the people in this room are  fantastic your editors are amazing and I  think you're making an excellent show  wow and so if I have notes I'll think  about it on the toilet tomorrow I'm sure  and I'll text them to you well I can't  wait for those and look at you rob  taking on the wings of death clearing  every wing no water no milk let the  record show now there's nothing left to  do but roll out the red carpet for you  this camera this camera this camera let  the people know what you have going on  in your  life just this morning I I mentioned to  my wife uh that I was going to do hot  ones and I was complaining and she  reminded me she had two  children  naturally um I got a television show  Mythic Quest I've got another show It's  Always Sunny in Philadelphia they both  have a couple of Seasons airing very  very very soon and then there's welcome  to Rex him and that's it thank  you thank  [Applause]  you yeah they they said they I would be  like they wouldn't be able to go to  school if I tapped out which I wasn't  going to but that my one son was like  don't I I was like I'm probably going to  drink the milk and I still have it and I  feel good about that I'll get some water  backstage but I'm not cut cameras yes

Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we're joined by Lady Gaga she's  one of the most decorated multi- hyen it  stars of a generation a 13-time Grammy  award-winning singer songwriter with a  pair of Golden Globes and an Oscars as  well for her work in TV and film her  latest single Abracadabra is out now  with the next studio album coming very  soon and of course we can't wait for  that Lady Gaga welcome to the show thank  you Sean what's your mindset like going  into this interview are you a spicy food  fan by Nature I you know I do like spicy  food but I'm like feeling like I'm  saying that now and then it's going to  be really easy to make fun of me if I  like can't handle this so I'm but I'm  focused I can see that I'm determined  locked in step by step are you ready to  get started yes I just keep staring at  them okay I'm going to eat with one hand  cuz I'm almost by necessity fashion  impaired  that's  [Music]  good good I like it what's in it are you  going to is this this is not like a  culinary suar no but you know what you  can you can stress test me all right I'm  ready for it what okay so you said  garlic lemon garlic lemon and then it  has like an avocado oil out of Brooklyn  New York and so far it looks like we're  one for one I think it's fine there we  go good so I like how hyped you get  about production  like the excitement that you express  over the spicy scense on disease besides  your own vocal performance and  songwriting what are the elements of  production or Sound Engineering that you  find yourself obsessing over most while  making an album I feel like when I'm  making a record it's about like figuring  out how I'm going to hone in the sound  uh from song to song to make the album  feel holistic and uh it's about like  choosing the analog synth it's about  figuring out what guitars we're going to  use it's about figuring out um what the  like the tone is of the piano on the  record but always at the end of  producing an album I kind of revisit  every single song  to just like completely hone in my  vision for how it should  [Music]  sound lift off I don't think I can lift  off in this  dress Thai flavors mhm yummy citrusy you  catch the uh kind of lemongrass yummy  after there yeah really good there we go  two for two yeah I like them both I  think I like the first one better but it  was good that's all right we'll keep the  power rankings in our head this is where  we're starting yeah right right yeah no  it's a hum show front of the I know I  know I know so in the past I've asked  actors about the qualities that make for  a great film director I'm curious for  you what are the most important traits  that you look for in a music producer I  still feel like I did when I was a kid  when I write songs like I get so excited  about every lyric and every Melody and  what it could mean and then talking  about how to bring the song to life so I  definitely feel like uh collaboration is  super important childlike Spirit um and  uh yeah like musicianship and sometimes  you'll get just as excited talking about  Studios you know like when I hear you  name check them sometimes you'll talk  about them with such intimacy like  laying down Roots at shangry laugher for  example I'm curious is there like a Vibe  or like a tone or things that you look  for that make a studio feel like home to  you you  know sorry I just  yeah that it's it's the show it's the  show it's perfect um for me the home  feeling of a studio comes from the music  so I actually find that I can like build  that home feeling wherever I go um just  because I become so obsessed with what  we're doing that  the space kind of takes on a new life  but I do really love shanga it's really  close to my home so um I I do love being  there but yeah wherever the music is  that's home I'm about it  [Music]  yeah gorgeous so far I think I loved the  first one the most but I don't know if  it's because my tongue started going  numb  we got to this one what was your  favorite are you allowed to say is he  not allowed to say no I can I can say I  can talk okay but I don't want to here's  it's a little leading though cuz we  actually make this third one you know  what I mean so I actually oh you do make  the third one love the third one the  third so good it is I see it now hot one  Sriracha it's so funny you guys waited  26 episodes before you slid yours in  there love  that so uh you once compare writing born  this way to Immaculate Conception saying  that you wrote it in 10 [ __ ] seconds  oh my God I said that yeah that you  wrote it in 10 [ __ ] minutes wrot it  in 10 [ __ ] minutes W I did write it  in 10 minutes I can't um sorry now I'm  losing speech all part of the show from  it but uh I did write it in 10 minutes  for born this way and a lot of my songs  I hear it pretty quickly and then I just  have to follow it to me when I'm making  music I'm I say that I I'm listening so  it's a feeling of receiving which is  probably why I made that really dumb  comment about myself and then one of my  favorite quotes I've ever heard from a  singer songwriter also comes from you  where you said without a good chorus who  really gives a [ __ ] and I'm curious oh  my God who gave you these quotes but how  do you know when you've cracked the code  on a hook like is there a tell sometimes  I know something's done because that  image feels whole to me but you really  don't know if something is good and  until the people tell you and they will  tell you and they will tell  you you're like cheering me on okay I  like  [Music]  that  oh okay it is we're in the game now yeah  peppery I like it that's why they call  it hot one it's the most hot one so far  yeah it's not the hot one one which is  my  favorite do you have a most heroine  onstage memory reflecting back on those  early days performing on the Lower East  Side at places like the slipper room or  Mercury Lounge like yes did you ever  have to deal with hecklers or sing  someone in the front Row's eyebrows off  with a hairspray Fireball no I I  shouldn't have done that lighting  hairspray on fire I should not have done  but um I remember when me and Lady starl  were given a residency at the slipper  room and I was so excited it was such an  honor to be asked to perform there I  remember I made my outfit for my slipper  room show I sewed it myself I just look  back on that time so fondly my whole day  was spent trying to get those gigs and I  I just used would I would knock on door  after door after door and just say um  can I please play here or I would call  and pretend I was my  manager successfully I would tell people  I like she's so hot right now and  sometimes I would do like an accent and  yeah I mean I I would do anything to get  booked what was the most valuable music  or performance lesson that you learned  covering classic rock songs with your  band Mac and pulsifer in high school  like these the facts that you have the  quotes you know Mac and pulsifer yeah  you would do a classic rock covers with  that band right does that give you like  any insight to the musicianship of a  rock star or anything or how do you  think that helped you I I used to always  say that you have to put like music in  the room to figure out how to be an  artist like you need an audience so I  just yeah I learned so much being in  that band and so funny when I met Bano  for the first time and I'm like I used  to sing  pride in my rock band growing up it's  cool like you you learn everything that  came before you and you're yeah just a  student of music  are we halfway we are halfway like doing  okay oh does it do that have a chicken  that is mouths on fire yeah fitting logo  going to be me  okay these are good wings too these I  think I have the the plant-based ones me  too by the way they're good  mhm in what ways if at all does being a  classically trained pus serve as like a  superpower for a songwriter like how  might studying the classics inform your  approach to making pop music Beethoven  Bach a lot of the structure of them is  very similar to a pop song um it's the  the progression of the music uh also the  way that you learn about uh music  getting louder and softer uh getting  faster and slower um holding  punctuations like all of the expressions  of Music can I think it taught me how to  think about where to put the drama in a  pop song  volcano  oh that's good yeah defin a kick and  that's the thing about some of these in  the later half is they have a little  like time release on them or they hear  you talking about them you know what I  mean they come back yeah exactly that  feels  deceptive so good really good so there  are a few Highwire acts in pop culture  more impressive than threading the  needle between High art and pop I'm  curious how do you think about that  distinction at this stage in your career  You music is something that you hear but  then you know when you when you add the  art to it it really changes the way you  feel and it changes the way you think  about the song so I I to me it is it's  awesome it's an awesome awesome piece of  of music is the  [Music]  visuals I'm doing good  [Music]  I took a big break I saw that I don't  know why I did that because you're  feeling you said it was because you're  feeling  it it's going to hit good though mhm but  is it going to come and get me like  really soon I'll be honest it's kind of  getting me right now is it yeah are you  okay yeah you're dancing on me on my  show yeah I know I know all  right 10 years trying to be all but I  won't drink my water and same with you  haven't drank your water yet I always  mirror the guest oh you know I don't  know if it's like are you thirsty should  I  drink I'll let you know I'll let you  know if I need you trying to I'm just  trying to be a bad [ __ ] and like not  have the  water so when we had Shakira on the show  she talked about how she bankrupted her  first world tour because it was  important for her to have this giant 30  foot cobra with her on stage which of  course cost millions of dollars to  produce and then Millions more to ship  is someone who has long reinvested right  I knew you'd like that respect one set  piece that we built which was like  really cool actually 3D sculpture that  Nick Knight built he put me inside a a  grand piano made this huge statue but we  just like  didn't it was so early in my career I  didn't plan like how it would get on and  off the stage it was so heavy and the  crew guys were like we cannot get this  this thing is as big as the arena we  can't put it on the stage that was  pretty expensive and a bad decision I  definitely now try to be a lot more  resourceful like just make making less  and uh not over um overproducing things  like I just want to be more resourceful  I'm growing  [Music]  up okay well  [Music]  ready oh oh God oh my God yeah  [Music]  Sean I Big Bite yeah I know I saw  that I'm trying to deny oh it's growing  yeah mhm and same with me but whatever  you're going through it's okay can I  have a sec yeah yeah you don't have to  ask me I'm just looking for an excuse  [Music]  too it's so hot I know yeah and it'll  kind of be like that for a little bit  and it might even grow a little bit from  here but that's just me being an honest  talk show host with my guest you  know yeah it's happening so one time you  did a cooking segment with Allan Carr  where you tenderized a chicken breast by  just beating the hell out of it with a  pan do you have any other unconventional  kitchen hacks you know like that did  seem to work way better than a meat  mallet ever could no it's the show and  just be careful around your eyes just be  careful around your eyes you know is  this  safe I'm made at 10 years you know I'm  still standing still  okay do I need the milk yeah that might  help you know you really set me up to  really just eat [ __ ] on that one we kind  of set ourselves up on this show though  too you know no beating beating um meat  with a frying pan is like very  Italian um  oh oh my  [Laughter]  God and they keep me laughing so hard I  know I  know I was fine everything was going so  well that's how this show goes that you  know everything's going so well until  it's not okay it's like now I'm  numb what if I stop  swallowing what do you what do you  [Music]  do my mouth is like actually numb on the  it's like  [Music]  swollen remember the last one I'm sorry  I'm picking my teeth Let It Go my nails  lean into it these things work for  that it was actually when it is good  it's just oh and now my lips are burning  no I know  changed but this is what we do it for  you know and I kind of come alive a  little bit I see  that you are  thriving I'm okay  mhm did you have a biggest customer pet  peeve when you worked as a waitress at a  Palma on Cornelia Street oh more fun  facts that you have  okay well when didn't tip that was not  good  yeah um I'm you know I'm like  having it's a lot yeah it's a lot it's a  lot okay uh what else did I I I always  was confused when they didn't order the  desserts cuz the desserts were really  good but I guess I didn't really have a  pet peeve I was really happy to have a  job so is that like a bad answer I don't  know if my answers are good anymore this  I'm not entertaining right now no  actually I'm so sorry actually you're  very entertaining right now right I've  ruined  [Music]  it the last dab experience I fear it  will be my last life  experience oh  okay okay okay I have to put it back  lady Go got would have run this it's  been real Sean  I'm just my be  hot I  know but Lady Gaga long last the wings  of death are behind us over 91% pepper X  yeah yeah don't read the fine print not  at this point in the show you added more  I don't want anything to grow I know I  know I don't want it to grow I want it  to grow but you've conquered the wings  you've made it through and I just one  more question for you you know you once  distilled the experience the artist Life  by saying it's a beautiful disco ball  that's somehow refracted and fractured  with that in mind I'm curious what's  like the closest you've ever come to  walking away you know like whether it  was a specific project or something more  existential like just the experience of  being an artist I'm curious what that's  like from your side that is a incredibly  deep question to ask me in this  yeah I missed the community that I had  in New York and that was really hard so  there were definitely times where I felt  like maybe I should walk  away but I'm know for sure that I never  would because if I I would definitely  say that I I like was  tested and I always I always didn't give  up and I'm still doing it so it must  mean I want to do it and you know what  you didn't give up today either no quit  and you Lady Gaga taking on the wings of  death and living to tell the tale now  there's nothing left to do but roll out  the red carpet for you this camera this  camera this

questions and even hotter wings  and today we're joined by Quest love  he's a six-time Grammy awardwinning  musician and Oscar award-winning  director his latest documentaries are  Sly lives chronicling the legendary  musician Sly Stone set to drop on Hulu  February 13th and he's also unpacking  the 5 decade long history of Music in  studio 8h with his documentary 50 years  of SNL music and it's also his birthday  happy birthday to you quest love and  welcome to the show thank you for having  me how are you around hot sauce before  we get started I hope we just don't ruin  the celebration I'd like to think that  I'm relatively great with hot sauce um  but my nose is already telling me this  was a mistake so  like I shouldn't I shouldn't taste the  hot sauce  [Music]  already I'm ready to get started  [Music]  oh  okay fair mhm it's actually  [Music]  tasty are we allowed to keep these like  when it's over or no we going to pack  these all up for you and you'll take  them to go I actually like this so I  loved your 50 years of SNL music  documentary which really put into  perspective how culturally impacted SNL  is as a platform for artists if you were  to put together a timeline what would  you say are like the three to four most  important Watershed musical moments in  SNL history I started to notice early  that there are more iconic musical  sketches on the show than actual  performances first I was just going for  the artist that came on the show artist  wise Nirvana's performance Adele's  performance was probably a watershed  moment for both of their careers in  which the after effect of being on SNL  became immediate but you know the  cowbell  sketch Eddie Murphy's hot tub you know  the Wayne's World theme like music is is  I know that people see SNL as a comedy  show but I feel like it's a musical  variety show like I don't feel as though  the generation truly knew who James  Brown was until Eddie Murphy put in  context the same for Stevie Wonder like  Eddie Murphy imitating those art artist  actually helped sustain them past the  so-called expiration  [Music]  date okay this is  LOF it's actually  tasty I'm impressed well I hope that we  can sustain that all the way through  here okay well while we're on the topic  of 50e celebrations I have to imagine  that it was incredibly stressful to put  together that star studded tribute to  Hip Hop's 50th Ann I AR at last year's  Grammy  Awards yeah can you give us your highest  high and lowest low my lowest low  reflecting back on all that it took to  put that performance together I'll do it  in reverse my lowest  low was losing two key  artist 20 minutes before we go to air  it's a live show so it's like between  commercial breaks you're running through  the choreographer you're you're  disappointing a bunch of dancers that  are no longer going to be on television  the highest high however um that moment  where little Uzi vert ends the the  medley um totally unplanned I had sent  out a desperation text it was like when  you hear your song please run on stage  and I pressed send and then I got the  rainbow wheel and then I didn't realize  that my phone was on the entire time so  my phone went dead so I actually left  the stage having a panic attack having  no clue that Uzi got my text and did it  the roots had to show me on social media  like what are you talking about Uzi was  on stage I was like no man I R it and  they literally had to go online and say  look he went on and that's when I was  like so it it was the most stressful  period of of my professional career and  I don't highly recommend  [Music]  it wait time out yeah khed quit like by  Wing number three you're in the you're  on the khed zone right here you got one  foot on this side and one foot on this  side of the khed  Border this is like a a Monday to me  like okay can you talk me through the  mechanics of creating a theme song like  hey Jimmy for The Tonight Show like do  you reference talk shows of the past or  how is that like a uniquely singular  task for a musician uh that theme for  The Tonight Show was an absolute  accident so the songs that we create for  the show are called sandwiches which I  love by the way I love some industry  specific vernacular call them sandwiches  uh Quincy Jones used to call them  Polaroids like small demos that will  become a song later we probably have  4,000 plus sandwiches that theme is  actually sandwich number one just like  do anything and just one two 3 four and  that's what came  out of it but we  didn't we didn't pay attention to it and  then I think it accidentally came on  Jimmy's like what's that what's that and  we're like oh no that was just us  messing around whatever he's like that's  the theme like we we had submitted like  at least 19 other themes and none of  them were making it so kind of our  accident of hey hey hey hey came into  play  [Music]  so loco fire  little tag like you're little trailer to  the movie that's coming later yeah  that's exactly right Taste of what's to  come  okay so oh wow okay yeah okay I know and  that's the road that we're on Quest a  transparent host over here two fonsy  over here we're just going to be cool oh  wow okay so I asked Dave gr this  question I'm curious your thoughts yeah  what do you think people get wrong when  they debate the greatest drummers of all  time like do you pay attention to that  discourse or have any thoughts of your  own wow okay okay okay  okay wow okay oh wow all right what  number was that four that's four that's  four y all right don't think about it  that way four down you know glass half  full I'm  good the more wow okay so it's like when  I  inhale I feel it maybe I should just  breathe out my nose right right right  you're bringing oxygen to that fire  yeah okay I feel like um I'm certain  most rock drummers especially of this  generation think of like Smells Like  Teen  Spirit you know so I'm the opposite the  less you  play uh the more effective you are  because I'm also an engineer I know that  the lighter you play the better your  drums sound in in the mix why am I  holding my hands in prayer I think  that's just natural at this time you  know just like it can't hurt at a time  like this the trepidation that  uh  okay Rose Kellan  is this still more tasty than is spicy  did I just lose my voice there no okay  this is musical that sounded  great so you just seem like the right  person to ask but what worries you the  most about the ways that music is  consumed and discovered nowadays like  with the extinction of physical media  and the rise of algorithms and streaming  does anything worry you about that I  will say that uh probably after the  invention of the remot control we kind  of became an impatient Society where  it's like I just want the highlight real  and not to see how you got there so  sometimes I'm guilty of it too like when  a new album comes out I I like I'll give  the 45 second test do I like it nope do  I like it you know and then of course  like months go by and then you uh  discover that you know there there's a  gem had you just sat with the music  longer so you can carry a life's work an  entire cannon in your pocket but the  other thing is like how are you going to  get through that how how do how do I  answer that without it was eloquent it  was beautiful to see from this side of  the table I got to be honest with you  quest love I think you're locking in I'm  in a Zen place right now I I got up at  5: this morning determined not to be I  think that's the thing people come on  here and they're like I will not be a  meme I will not be a meme I will not be  a  [Music]  meme  [Music]  okay wait am I Cry right now no okay  I'll let you know and if anything that's  just the dramatic effect of that it  plays well in the video I got to be real  with you I'm good man I'm good did you  have a biggest wow I wish I was there  for that moment or that concert  reflecting back on all the archival  footage you look through to put together  your documentary for Sly in the Family  Stone so there's there's a a concert  that we  were okay this is like double dutch with  where when I exhale I don't feel it as  much but when I H inhale I feel it a lot  and so I got just hold that breath it  all out yeah I got to time the the  words this is what I feel like right  now  okay in the mid-70s people just trade  War Stories of how long they had to sit  in audience until he decided to show up  you know they they caught this concert  it just start starts out with Relentless  booing the audience is pissed Boo Boo  and the way he  singlehandedly just like walks out on  stage and I don't know if he's doing  this to  them or whatever but he singlehandedly  just talked himself out of an ass  whipping or or tomatoes being thrown  like he literally gets on stage and  doesn't even acknowledge he's just like  well actually does he's like hey man  it's my fault I'm you know guilty so I  can either play or we can leave like  what what what do y'all want you know  like he single-handedly he turned the  crowd turned it around and I was like yo  this is like Master manipulation just a  level of Jedi Mind tricking it would  have been interesting to watch him turn  a crowd over cuz after 1972 like there  was more riots reported and just civil  unrest at a slide concert  Hot House hot  sauce now you catch kind of like almost  a pickle in  there I'm trying to analyze this mhm  that breaches the  door oh is this how y'all get  me some like this this where vastic went  yeah that store from the vastic  commercial yeah he invested in  oh  yo  okay okay how would you describe what a  typical talent show is like at  Philadelphia's high school for Creative  and Performing Arts in the late 1980s  you know and reading about the talent  that you were surrounded by as a  teenager it's kind of  mind-blowing I had a time  machine uh for the infamous Valentine's  show in which the roots and back then I  think we were known as radio activity  going up against a group of unknown  singers called boy to men but Boys to  Men would keep oh yo I know oh yo it  hits your  trachea it just hit my trachea I I hate  when that happens oh my  God no I saw that I saw that no this is  an arm wrestling match yeah yeah and I'm  not going here I want some sort of  acknowledgement or PL you're on top that  I didn't go to  this um I was good until the one little  piece that was like caught my teeth  decided to go down and tickle the back  of your throat what was that what was I  saying you were talking about how Boys  to Men oh  they they they um had glitter in their  hands and you know second verse they do  thing and the glitter would go and like  all the girls would start screaming like  as Beatles on Sullivan and I'm like yo  dog like they go to school with us  like they're nobody special they go to  school with us and you know I just I was  like man like if we just had like some  sort of a moment or you know make Tariq  do the whatever maybe I should have done  that cuz now  [Music]  all right man this is  it  okay  wa  [Music]  wa I got to catch up I will not be a  meme I will not be a meme and that wait  a I got to say wait a minute wait time  out yeah time come out mhm that's not  real unfortunately it is real it's very  real it is too real and what you just  did I don't know if I've ever even seen  that on De bomb  okay the answer is I didn't ask a  question  yet y I'm so humbled right I know I know  that's how it goes but that was an  ambitious bite that was a big jump you  got this question I a way to force me  into yeah breae it yeah just out just in  the morning I know I know I know I  should have done it what a way to  celebrate a  birthday when you're booked to doing a  DJ event oh wait wait what's the word  ice cream ice cream [ __ ] just  ask me a question yeah when you're  booked to DJ I no we have ice cream do  you want ice  cream we have ice cream it's right there  I feel like it's defeat if you have the  ice cream how many people have done this  without the aid of eight you know a very  elite  club we can just be careful around the  eyes be careful be careful be careful  when you're booked to do a DJ event  what's like the most annoying thing a  party go f can do while you're  performing a  set gu is this the part of the oh is  this where like the screen turns pink  and all that stuff yeah going to have a  field day over here yo I'm my God yo I'm  not like hi I'm so high right now wait I  look silly this is the meme where you  live in infamy just be careful around  the eyes but whatever I do I'm not  touching this water it's incredible or

that the fingers that you used  oh it's going against my interest right  now I know  yeah I'm good here's a stack here's the  stack this is H all right ask the  question the most annoying thing that  can happen is they ask me to play a song  that I just  play which tells me that they aren't  paying  attention ah just like like I'm not  paying attention to  whatever is  happening right now this is

the last  D whoever eats the most Wings loses go  ahead and spin it  you are answering the first question you  got  it okay Richard Ryan during your career  you were known for diligently studying  tape and preparation for each game  diligence what did your Scouting Report  say was my biggest weakness that's a  softball so such a sofball you're a risk  taker you're uh Reckless at times Brett  favian  and usually people say take that  positively but Brett Favre led the NFL  in interceptions for a lifetime and I  was happy to hear that because you know  the shman family does appreciate the  fitzpatricks and  everything they got me  twice well Ryan you played for a record  setting nine teams during your time in  the NFL which team were you most excited  to leave  it's a really good question they're  going to hate you when you say this no  I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to  go ahead and eat a wing I'm going to  take the smallest one  here yeah go for it just go that yeah  flavor oh that's a nice  chunk oh a two bider you might have a  little African-American in  you it's starting to get for no it's  actually it's not terrible so far I'm  actually feeling  okay and I've got my shirt as a napkin  too I wore like a  cloth your relationship with Tom Brady  has evolved from mem worthy Rivals to  Tampa teammates tell your most  embarrassing firsthand Brady story that  the goat wouldn't want you sharing I  don't I wish I had it he doesn't have  embarrassing moments he's the goat even  when he falls he meant to do it even  when he trips he meant to do it he threw  interceptions that he meant to throw so  I don't I don't have an embarrassing  story I wish I had something but what's  something what's a trait of his his  personality that just really pissed you  off he's cocky he's arrogant and so am I  so you like that you know as I laugh and  breathe feel the he down my  throat are you ever going to are we  talking about the wings I mean I want to  but then you're you're you're scaring me  away from eating the wings I would just  say you should probably eat a wing  because you didn't provide us with  anything about Tom Brady there that was  so now since I didn't make things up I  have to eat a  wing wow it's the kind of guy you  are are you good with spice I'm pretty  good with spice dang it all  right wild  card last Christmas mhm you remember I  do you gifted me with a portrait of the  two of us made out of Rubik's Cubes yeah  yeah the cubes let's see which one of us  can do one fastest whoever takes we  we're not going to get through this guys  let's do this whoever takes the longest  to solve theirs must eat a death Wing I  love that all right have you ever solved  a cube before Sherm this would be my  first but I'm a clutch player okay so  it's not happening is what you're  telling me that's what I'm telling you  if it happens it's by accident  luckily I have been practicing with the  kids I've got five of my seven are Avid  cubers first off who calls a that we're  part of a community sh okay we're  getting there we're getting towards the  end I'm just trying to make this super  dramatic for TV you  [Music]  know oh a lot of the same color  I feel like you have to eat a wing now  because mine is I kind of feel like you  you moved the did you take the stickers  off here how about I show you this this  is called the sexy move okay so you can  do  this just working on your finger tricks  so you do it eight times and it's  finished you get it 16  times who taught you that  napkin friendship  test I'm going to write down my answer  and you have to guess my response guess  wrong and you eat a Deathwing now I feel  like we become pretty good friends over  the last 2 and 1 half years know that  way too and I would be really upset if  you didn't get this correct because I  feel like you should know me in high  school I was let go from my job at  Wendy's after just 2 weeks ah damn what  was the reason for my  firing so I was the burger flipper that  was like my main job mhm um that's all  I'm going to tell you that answer is  very long yeah I saw several paragraphs  um now it wasn't a very worthwhile job  because I always ate more than I made  cuz I just work the lunch shift but I  was a guy back there flipping burgers  that's your only clue that I'm going to  give  you I got nothing it's only one  Deathwing you got nothing you got no  guesses I got no guesses that's a dumb  question okay well wow um what happened  was I made a  burger put it in the thing gave it to  them to serve and I forgot to put the  burger in the bun so it was just a bun  and they fired you God you know what I'm  going to eat a wing because I should  have known to put the Patty you should  have  [Music]  known ooh the shirt is doing great who  made that I don't is that  race see this is way easier this is a  common sense question my Harry Potter  fandom is well documented mhm which  hogwart's house would I belong to if you  put Slytherin I'm going to be so mad  you're not a  slyther raven I'm just  [Music]  kidding we need a spell check I don't  know if there's a y in it or not is it  why I don't know we'll go Wing we'll go  wing for whoever spelled it incorrectly  it might be ey it might be a y here I  wanted to put the Y here at first are we  both wrong both wrong you are both  wrong how am I looking now g r y f i n d  o yeah you were right youing I knew it  was an ey there  though I'm very proud of myself right  now you're doing great a little bit in  your  beard I'm feeling good which one's  hotter this is the experience I feel  like we need a little dab dab and dip  you want me to put it on your just put  and I mess on your wing board scoop it  like famous last  words you and superow 59 headliner  Kendrick

      "page_content": "no this is something's happening I know  it's a cumulative effect yeah of the  show over here I'm fine with the spice  so far but like my body is like what's  [Music]  this hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we're joined by Ariana Grande  she's a Grammy award-winning singer  songwriter and pop music icon with a  pair of momentous projects in 2024 her  seventh studio album Eternal Sunshine  which opened at number one and later  this year you can catch her in her role  as ginda in the film adaptation of the  Broadway hit musical Wicked set to  release in theaters on November 22nd  Ariana Grande welcome to the show thank  you for having me I'm so excited what's  your mindset like going into this like  do you feel prepared for this Gauntlet  of hot sauces in front of you I feel  present and I feel as ready as I'll ever  be I feel very excited I invited myself  I asked I begged to come here so it's  too late to turn back and I'm here  you're a hostage here on hot ones are  you ready to get started yes I'm I'm  [Music]  ready that doesn't count I have to do  better than this that's tiny time all  right I'll join you okay  [Music]  delicious that's really good my favorite  song on Eternal Sunshine is I wish I  hated you and I'm curious how do you  make songs sad from like a technical  perspective like beyond your lyrics and  natural emotional expression are there  chord progressions or song structures  that help elicit that kind of emotional  reaction yeah definitely well with with  I wish I hated you by the way thank you  I didn't expect you would have heard it  but thank you um with that song I  actually got the Beat from Ilia who  produced that song and it was already  that emotional what you hear on the  record is what he sent me the first time  often you'll write a song to a beat and  then it will change based on what's  written on top of it or we'll start at  the piano and then whatever but that was  the first thing he sent me and the last  thing that was sent to mix was that  track so it was already really emotional  as soon as I heard it I started crying  and I didn't know why but it just  sounded like the right place to put  something like that I think sort of  emotional intention leading the way can  sometimes inform the music to just fall  out how it needs to and I'm so grateful  to work with my producers they're so  brilliant and I'm spoiled rotten  [Music]  really you'll learn this quickly I'm  long winded by the way I'm not coming in  proud or cocky or  confident I'm shriveling you just are  I'm shriveling and weak and  honest that's where we like that's where  we like a guest perfect positioning mhm  what do you expect of my performance  today like where do you think I'll sit  on the scale from DJ KH to Lord where do  you think I'll where do you think I'll  that is the scale you didn't properly  position the scale I do my homework  where do you think I'll be huh well your  attitude coming into this is incredible  I'm not just saying that so I think when  you approach something with that kind of  attitude I think you can accomplish  anything so I'm going to go Lord leaning  o but however it happens however it  happens is how it's supposed to happen  that's so nice that's a nice and that's  a lie and it's nice thank you for the  uninitiated what's it toron and how  would you say it's best used oh my God  you really do your homework it's kind of  like like a a midi thing but it's also  like an instrument in in its own you can  program it to play sounds from program  like Ableton or play something from like  a certain session how did you think to  ask that that's so crazy I haven't had  one since I was younger so I don't  really know how it's evolved since I was  like 14 or we got to get you a new one  yes oh my god really what's a looping  machine a looping machine is is  something that basically Loops whatever  sound you're singing into the microphone  or playing into the microphone um I fell  in love with it from watching image and  Heap at a young age she's my favorite  musician of all time and she used it to  sort of build her song Live to watch her  do it and really show the audience like  yeah all those sounds all those like  Lush emotional chords that you're  hearing those like pads are my voice and  here's how I got there so she like takes  the time  it's like a 10 to 15 minute performance  and She lays it all out um I was really  inspired by that when I was younger and  um I'm such a nerd for musical  production and like vocal production  yeah big fan of fermented  kimchi it's there mhm it's beautiful  you're into it yeah the notes are  [Music]  romantic this is a lovely pickly  kimchi bouquet that one's that one's  like lovely there we go we'll pack it up  for you take it to go thank you just for  you Ariana thank you so in an interview  with Vanity Fair Wicked director John  Chu mentioned your commitment to doing  live vocals while filming even though he  was originally skeptical saying when we  were shooting it those girls were like  [ __ ] the pre-record we're going live  what was the most unique situation you  found yourself singing in like did you  ever have to perform while hanging from  a wire or harnessed into a floating  bubble well yes there was lots of bubble  singing which was very high up and I  wasn't harnessed I was just kind of  there um and I had a lot of uh like  stunty singing things but nothing  compares to Cynthia ARA this is my  favorite thing in the entire world  watching Cynthia  in her harness with a broom a hat like  wig corset dress like the whole thing  flipping upside down flying around the  set singing toine gravity every take  like it's nothing like just the most  phenomenal thing I've ever seen in my  life oh my God I love her we had to do  some really insane and beautiful things  for this film and it was just so much  fun how we doing after three Wings very  good crushing it this next one is Los  Calientes Barbacoa here in the four spot  this has a more Saucy side it I found  this one does you found the Saucy  side don't we all have a saucy side  mhm not for  me it's not a spice problem it's a a  flavor problem it's a tone yeah it's  disgusting is this one that you famously  hate we actually make it  I love  it it's my favorite so  far so David burn of the Talking Heads  he has a quote where he says the better  a singer's voice the harder it is to  believe what they're saying does that at  all resonate with you or do you disagree  I see where he's coming from but I no I  don't think that one negates the other  like I think if there someone has a pure  some of the most beautiful performances  have like perfect pure gorgeous tone you  know why you why are you laughing at me  I'm not you know what at I'm really not  no I had a know getting into the fifth  Wing there was a face change that I  think you were picking up on but it was  honestly and this is me telling the  truth me going I've got a burp that's  sitting right here please it's a same  that I'm trying to keep down you know  back half I'll let him fly but that's  that's what you saw right there I'm be  honest with you we're still getting to  the fifth Wing I get  [Music]  it it's perfectly good I love that  [Music]  tagline why are you  laughing no my face changed because I  think I'm learning that um I don't I  don't like hot  sauce you are on top of the spice I'll  say that you know I wouldn't be able to  tell that you're affected still Lord  leaning still Lord leaning well I got  we're we're only halfway there thank you  for your generos and your  warmth so when nyn was on the show  Justin Timberlake talked about how that  memorable pronunciation and it's going  to be me was actually a note from Max  Martin who said May it's going to be May  because of his Swedish accent I'm  curious do you ever get notes from him  that maybe sound a little bit strange at  face value but actually serve to make  the record more memorable absolutely one  of my favorite most hilarious Max Martin  memories and I this man I love him so  much he is such an incredible friend and  inspiration to me I love him so much I  hope to work with him for our whole  lives um but one of my favorite memories  is when we were making Break Free I was  a lot younger and I did not want to do  the intonation on say I don't want you  and he was like no it really needs to be  like pingy like like annoying it has to  be like say I you and I was like fine  like this  I don't want you and he and that's what  made it to the record he was like  perfect thank you that's all I needed  and I was like this for the rest of my  life and now I and I'm so grateful for  it because I totally get it and it made  it so much better and I love that song I  love what that song has done for so many  people I love hearing the stories about  how it changed their lives and singing  it on stage makes me so happy so that's  not even a thing anyway but when I was  younger I was like is he  serious yeah  [Music]  oh my God it's giving me  hiccups I'm full  yeah the vegan wings are filling that's  for sure you can't really tell but  they're the size of like my hand gorilla  thumbs over here how would you describe  the impact that leak music has from an  artist perspective you know it's kind of  crazy how commonplace it's come and  casual attitude towards something that  effectually amounts at that yeah it's  hard I it's really hard for me  because it's really disheartening and  it's like  disappointing  and it sucks and I am constantly trying  to get to the bottom of like how people  get stuff whether it's like videos or  pictures that or or  audio songs and then also like commented  on criticized blah blah blah so it's  conflicting because that is very  frustrating and feels very dehumanizing  and then the other side is like but I'm  so grateful to be an artist that people  care about and my FS want more of me so  they're going to these extremes to steal  and break in  um it's so lovely to be loved no um but  yeah I sit somewhere in between like  being grateful to be here at all  um and being like but really come on so  that's how I  feel blackeyed Susan it's my drag  name that was the joke I used before we  were rolling and he said save these yeah  it got no laughs this time the first  time it was a hit and now it's nothing  nothing  okay all right Susan  you're good I'm weirdly good hold on I  don't trust this am I just like I'll  join  you  num you could be I don't think so  though my insides know something's  happening as something is a foot mhm I'm  like fine but like I'm fine here that's  all right don't fight against the winds  you know what I mean clock them no is  something's happening I know it's a  cumulative effect yeah of the show over  here I'm fine with the spice so far but  like my body is like what's  this why so De La Soul recently released  a recording of a 1996 live show where  they introduced their hit me myself and  I by calling it the one that we can't  stand but everyone is digging are there  any songs that you've retired from the  live show or ones that you'd be happy to  retire if fans didn't crave them so much  of course I mean I think  of course that's like a natural thing  that all artists probably can relate to  but seeing their reaction to it also  kind of replaces that yeah does that  make sense mhm there was a time when it  was hard for me to feel that same  gratitude that I do now for certain  songs and for the music because I think  some of it was like a stressful time and  I think becoming a pop star is INS is  insane at 19 or 20 and I think that  experience was sort of to some of the  songs a little bit or like some of the  songs that are more emotional that this  the experience that inspired them can be  married to the music for me for a second  um but with time and therapy we we sort  of are able to re-embrace so I feel just  really proud and grateful and happy when  I hear them I I'm like that's a good  song whereas I used to maybe hear it and  cry so that's a beautiful thing yeah  gross cheers to the next Wing which is  I'm talking so much because I'm delaying  the  inevitable it's why we're here yeah  that's why we're here okay Cheers  Cheers I took a big bite I know I saw  that  mhm same give me a moment yeah take your  time give her a moment please you're  right she's working I'll sit back  right excuse me I burped oh my God it's  all okay Long Leash on this show it's a  safe space it's a safe space You Can Let  it Fly and I might start hiccuping a  little bit through this it's weird cuz  my  tongue is aware yeah and my brain feels  like um it's being invited to fight or  flight like like to hover above and  watch us do this right now yeah because  not here anymore uh-huh but I'm like not  I'm but I'm fine yeah but I like this  all-encompassing experience that you  have when you eat you know like you take  a bite and I feel like you really get to  know the sauce before passing any sort  of judgment on it and then you know  whether it's hot or whether it's  understanding where someone has come  from why they how they get where they  are and who you know like yeah with the  uh I have empathy for Wing  a that's right you know so many people  come on the show and they come in here  and they dog it and they call it battery  acid you yeah with we bully this little  saw so much on this show and it bullies  us to be fair but you're right you know  how dare we assume or project onto them  you're right we we don't know where  they've come from you know right you  don't get Beyond andany out of nowhere  yeah no it's it's happening yeah my lips  feel it it's nice no it feels like  plumper like lip gloss does  I'm scared to do water cuz I think it's  going to make it worse yeah it might it  might is coffee helping you tell me I've  never done a black  coffee you tell  me would you like sure give it a try  yeah oh sorry oh thank you very  much keep it please are you sure yeah  you know what it doesn't not not work  you know is that like some hack that we  that we just figured out here on this  show I think it is Black Coffee an  anecdote I'm going to try this whatever  it is is almond milk almond milk for you  thank you and for me actually I'll Chase  little almond milk with the coffee and  the hot sauce you  know that's been the worst that was the  biggest reaction we've had all day that  was the worst part so far  okay I think there's something waiting  for me here you were trying to surprise  or you've relaxed a little bit you know  and then it comes up and bites you you  know oh you think I was just performing  I  see The Taste is just terrible yeah it's  just disgusting we're in that kind of  world over here this is all horrible  have you discovered the perfect vent  diagram between veganism and Sicilian  cooking and if so how would you describe  your perfect dish no it's so funny  because my family always forgets I I  don't think they forget I think they  don't want to remember and my Nona  always offers me meatballs and I'm like  no thank you like I'm still plant-based  and still sorry I'm sorry thank you but  you know it's um it's what it is I'm not  alone my my brother-in-law hail is also  vegan so we have each other trying to  navigate those Sunday night dinners mhm  I'm looking for the ideal afternoon in  boa ratone Boomers oh my God Boomers  overrated or underrated is underrated  you can't overrate Boomers it's Boomers  tell me like how do I

      "page_content": "that's really bad I know I get it you  shouldn't do this to  [Laughter]  [Music]  people hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we're joined by Lupita nango she's  an academy award-winning actress you  know from films like 12 Years a Slave us  the Star Wars franchise Black Panther  and many more you can also catch her  starring in the much anticipated  apocalypse prequel a quiet place day one  which is set to release in theaters on  June 27th Lupita nango welcome to the  show thank you so much I'm really  excited to be here what's your mindset  like going into this are you at all  nervous staring down these spicy wings  in front of you I am terrified my heart  is beating so fast I'm like having  trouble staying still I really need to  get to the end and I don't know whether  I have like the What It Takes I don't  know what it takes the strength you have  it in you I can sense it in the room we  all feel it l are you ready to get  started  [Music]  yes over here yep oh boy that  [Music]  is okay  [Music]  okay this is an encouraging  start so a film like a quiet place day  one out of necessity features a bare  minimum of spoken dialogue from an  acting perspective is there anything  unique or exciting about playing a  character who has to remain quiet for  their own Survival sometimes as actors  we can get caught up in learning lines  and not listening to our scene Partners  when you don't have lines and and  everything is in the Nuance of of bodily  and facial expression you have to listen  in every take in a way more like nuanced  way so it makes it more exciting  actually I I found it very liberating  and one can't help but to root for froto  throughout this film how would you  distill the experience of working  opposite a cat well first of all I was  very afraid of cats before I took this  film and it was one of the things that  was holding me back from saying yes wow  the cat was the real number one of this  show you know because when the cat's on  set everything has to cater to the cat  everybody's got to be quiet nobody can  make any sudden movements and that was a  little Annoying I have to say upstage by  the cat totally upstage by the cat and  then we would do a take and I would  think it was great and Joseph Quinn  would think it was great and then they'd  say well the cat was looking at the  camera you have to do that again you  kind of just want but yeah so patience  is what I learned  [Music]  that's not a good  name it's got flavor mhm M it's not  assaulting at all no reason to be  nervous  Lupita you're setting me up no I know I  would never I would never I would never  do that you know you can watch so many  of these episodes but then because you  can't taste it nothing truly prepares  you absolutely not yeah no idea what  people's tongues can handle you know  right you can only find out by sitting  in that seat being brave enough Lupo to  sit in that seat  indeed so fear is such a draining  emotion I'm curious the extent to which  you're actually inducing a fight ORF  flight response when you're portraying  Terror like is making a scary movie  especially exhausting it really is and I  forgot how exhausting it was when I said  yes to this movie when you're doing a  scene where you're afraid it's just like  it takes so much  energy and it's take after take after  take you know like fear in real life  adrenaline an adrenaline surge is short  and the intention is not to stay there  you're you know you feel fear you run  away you you do something but when  you're making a scary movie you just  have to keep inducing that so Joe and I  sometimes we like huddle and just like  you know hype each other up and and you  know get our hearts going and kind of  like athletes is how we'd approach it  when we were low on energy off the top  of your head and without thinking about  too much what in your opinion is the  scariest or most unsettling horror movie  ever made you know the film that scared  me most was it's not even a horror film  but it's a beautiful mind A Beautiful  Mind oh yeah I watched that and I  thought I was schizophrenic for at least  two weeks the psychology could be scary  to you cuz I really believed that he was  a spy at the beginning of that movie and  so when we learned learn that he was  actually just sick in the mind I felt  like I was definitely probably like him  cuz he was very  [Music]  convincing I don't taste a  kimchi but it has flavor I think when  when um hot things have flavor they're  so much easier to take right well you  know what I think like after doing this  job for so long you start to respect  like when people thread that culinary  needle right where something is super  spicy maybe it's uncomfortable to eat  but it's so good that it's always  inviting the next bite you kind of yeah  you're exploring the flavor and yeah  your tongue is excited because it's  being stimulated in all sorts of places  so when Viola Davis was on the show she  talked about the science of picking out  the Perfect audition monologue do you  remember which monologue you chose and  why for your Yale drama School showcase  oh that's a really good question  I did a piece  from AAL fugard's hello and goodbye it's  a South African playwright that was my  dramatic piece and then I did Juliet  from Romeo and Juliet so I did Juliet  because ID played her already and I was  familiar with the entire play and I did  hello and goodbye because I had actually  taken a short course at the uh at Lambda  London Academy of Music and dramatic  arts while I was in Kenya  and that had been one of my my pieces  for for that um program so there were  things I knew do what you know mhm you  know when you go through this kind of  training and then you go and you start  making movies I'm curious does the  training ever brush up awkwardly with  like the realities of being on a  Hollywood set oh  yes when you're in drama school you  spend your day making a fool out of  yourself you're doing all sorts of vocal  warm-ups you know those things that you  see in all sorts of spoof about acting  and they're very helpful now when you're  in a on a Hollywood set and everybody's  looking at you and egos are running high  and you feel your voice is breaking or  something like that and you really just  want to do an awkward warmup but you  have a whole crew staring at you it  feels really weird and you want to shake  and go and everyone's just looking at  you like you're crazy and one of the  things that I do and I've had to just be  like [ __ ] it I'm going to do it because  it's what's going to help me in this  room Ro when I'm making scary movies one  of the things I do is run in place  before a shot because it gets my  adrenaline going it gets my heart going  and I need to be in that state of  intensity for the scene so like the ad  has to wait for me everybody gets ready  and then Lupita is doing her awkward  jump and and and running man on the spot  and yeah it doesn't feel good and I  don't know what people are going home  saying about me but I'm just like listen  I got to do what I got to do  you ask such engaging questions you  forget that you're eating these  scorching hot chicken wings yeah yeah  yeah I appreciate  you I'm going to be just fine  man I'm going to be fine so I've heard  you say that you need to satisfy the  intellectual understanding of a  character before you can delve into the  emotional aspects of it MH I'm curious  is there one character from your  filmography that stands out as being the  hardest to crack the logic of oh for  sure when I did um us playing both  Adelaide and  red was a complete mind [ __ ]  because spoiler I mean they are it's all  right it's been out it's it's been out  it's okay it's been out it's on them if  they haven't seen they get you when  you're doing the Press tour don't say  this don't say that and you're like oh  God years later statute of limitations  it's okay  so you know they they're they're they're  they're the opposite right and so it was  almost like a mathematical calculation  building both characters it was very  very difficult to keep the lines  straight and so it took a lot of very  odd  diagrams would you stay in character as  red on set well yes and no the vocal  posture was very difficult to get into  so what I would do is at the beginning  of the day I would warm up and get into  my vocal posture and then I would hold  that all day it just so happened that me  holding my vocal posture made everybody  on set really nervous i' imagine and  everybody would whisper around me and  everybody would avoid uh my my eyes and  they would just like be so awkward  around me and it was so entertaining but  I would I wouldn't stay in character in  the sense that I would go and I would  say things like I want a slice of pizza  and go crap service like that's what I  imagine yes exactly so um I it was it so  I kept the posture but I was very much  still myself but with an ominous  presence there we go I can feel it in  here I am feeling very good about this  [Music]  I'm so much better than this at this  than I realized and this one is a step  up but not for you yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah man You' got a good grip on it yeah  I'm halfway through and I'm chilling be  proud of yourself be proud of yourself  I'm proud of  myself my God God bless  Mexico oh my raise your right yeah yes  pay off muchas  your film little monsters it ends with a  singalong to Shake it Off by Taylor  Swift is it true that you personally  reached out to clear the song after  producers failed to clear the rights  correct yes what was your pitch like  well actually you know I had gone I when  I was working in in London on um Star  Wars um I was going through a lot of  self-doubt because it was the second  thing I had done I was getting a little  depressed my best friend came to London  and Taylor had just released um shake it  off and he played it for me to like get  me into better spirits and we just  jumped on my bed and we just danced and  danced and it lifted my spirits and so  when I read the script for a little  monsters that song and what it meant to  Miss Caroline and to the kindergarteners  it meant a lot to me that I was going to  get to play it on the ukulele and  everything so when they came and they  told me that ah no we can't get the  rights I decided okay I'm going to go  I'm going to make a pitch I'm going to  let Taylor know what this song means to  me and I told her that story about how  it Lifted Me from an almost depression  and the next thing I knew it was cleared  and Ive never I haven't actually seen  her since to thank her for it well you  can now oh thank you so much Taylor  thank you thank you thank  [Music]  you 245 okay  [Music]  mhm getting a little more serious over  here you have lied to  me listen you didn't walk onto the hot  one set thinking that you'd get through  totally unscathed did you but must it  jump like that you know what it's I  thought it was supposed to no no no  my friend no there is a  definite extreme jump that has just  occurred okay well I don't want to lie  to you anymore that's kind of the track  that we're on going forward all right  Lupo but you got it you got  it so I've heard you say that drama  school prepared you for struggle that it  prepared you for failure but not for  sudden Fame and opportunity did you find  that you were actively creating a public  person Persona in real time after the  Oscars catapulted that kind of Spotlight  on you when all of a sudden the  paparazzi were chasing me down and um  people would like scream when they saw  me and I real oh oh oh oh Something's  Happened just like what happened here  yeah I was a plebian and then I was not  there's a paradig shift it's just like  immediate so and I kind of reacted like  I did do these wings oh my God yes it  was odd and it was overwhelming and it  took me some time to um adjust to it to  be a public figure they have a  projection of who you are it's bestowed  on you and you kind of participate just  in the same way I there's a version of  me that is uh a sister and then there's  a version of me that is a that comes out  when I'm with my friends in Kenya in a  different version with my friends in  America code shifting is very much a  part of being human and so I code shift  into my public Persona and then I go  home and I'm I'm just  [Music]  AI you know I'm really  concerned it won't kill me right right  it won't kill me I'm still standing here  but what is this it's called what red  flag oh Lord  please please  there we  go what are the uh greatest lengths  you've ever gone to build a character's  backstory but why no no no no no I'm the  one who brought myself here yeah no  that's true at the end of the day you  know it's always a show I have to  apologize for in real time but yeah that  is  true and then just be careful around the  eyes oh my God yes yeah you know what  I'm saying I'm I'm on you oh my God I  know I'm same wavelength I feel no  you're not yes no you're not you're just  oh my God oh my God okay okay okay okay  hold on yep  wooo I I took ballet lessons for us and  that [ __ ] is  hard those people everyone says yeah  they look like they're flying they look  like they belly doing anything they the  gracefulness that they achieve is gnarly  yeah yeah there's a lot of the pay for  it is gnarly blood and sweat to get  there yes o I feel like I'm coming back  into my body right yeah right it can be  that kind of an experience yeah yeah and  then this is just me being an honest  with you do you want to move on do you  want to slow down I am I'm very  competitive and so I cannot stop neither  can I yeah no we've got to get to the  end that's the only way  I got these nails so that I wouldn't  have to touch them with my fingers and  it started  working very small cuz this will  [Music]  be I'm just sad now I'm just I know I  get it  I get it then just be careful be careful  oh my god oh I know I know I know I know  and I feel awful I feel awful from this  side of the set  God it's bad I know no I get it I get it  wow that's oh my God powerful I feel  like I'm looking at a scene that's like  that like only I can really see so it  feels special in this moment I know it  hurt my feet I  know but I'm telling you the worst is  over is it the worst is over can I trust  you you can you promise I promise you  promise I promise the worst is over you  promise okay now I'm starting to double  think but I'm telling you that's the  worst hot sauce you'll ever have in your  [Music]  life what in your opinion is the most  underrated salad dressing  [Laughter]  thank you I needed that  man I really like a lemon vinegret is it  underrated it's just lemon and vinegar  and olive oil and salt and pepper okay  right and it does clear right it's that  intensity it's and then you get to the  other side of it intense I do you think  it could be like do you think hot sauce  could be like an acting tool do you  think like it can like tap into  something that could work actually if  I'm ever playing a batet crazy person  I'm going to have to take that with me  yes this is going to be on my rider  there is a part of me that did feel like  I was like in a scene with you you know  there was like a a drama to it that I  felt kind of grateful and lucky to be  sitting across from when it was  happening oh my God and the thing is I  didn't know when it was going to end  that is scary it can put you in kind of  a panic right cuz you don't know where  the bottom is yeah yeah yeah and people  are watching you man I know right oh my  God small bit small  bite want I know even your small bites  ain't that small  of so I know that you worked as a  production assistant on film sets while  in college including in The Constant  Gardener I'm curious is there a job on a  film set that goes unseen by movie goers  but that you think is most important to  the final product jobs on  a I know but not like the bomb I I'm  jobs on a film set okay yeah like I want  to throw this at you I get it I get it I  get it jobs on a film set mhm that go on  scene yeah but that are really important  that are really  important um  this is like trivia I don't even  remember what a fil set looks like I  don't know what their official name is  but the people who keep the hygiene they  are extremely important because they can  make a break your day yeah um sometimes  you have costumes that are like  impossible to get in and out of and if  you're in a porta potty that is like  unacceptable you know it's not well  cleaned and  everything it can be it can be a major  problem major major problem so you know  thank you thank you to what are they  called I what I don't know but we  probably need some you know  yeah all right Lupita last  dab I have to go all the way it's all a  nothing Jesus  Christ okay okay did you do it I did you  did I did I swear

      "page_content": "stop being sunburnt and sunburn again  and then the skin peels off and you get  sunburn  again hey what's going on everybody for  first week Feast I'm Sean Evans and  you're watching hot ones it's the show  with hot questions and even hotter wings  and today we're joined by Chris  Hemsworth he's an actor and lionlike  figure in the action genre from the Thor  and Avengers films to rush the  extraction franchise and many more  coming May 24th you can catch him the  much anticipated George directed furiosa  Mad Max Saga Chris Hemsworth welcome to  the show thank you very much I've seen  you challenge yourself in Extreme Ways  you know from swimming in the Arctic to  climbing a 100ft rope that's suspended  from a helicopter how adventurous though  are you as an eater I like my food I  like my spice but this is this is about  as uh Extreme as I think I've  experienced so well you ready to get  started I'm excited this should be  Limitless season 2  [Music]  am I right this one that's the one  [Music]  yeah that's pretty simple it's got a  little little peppery mhm yeah  approachable nothing too crazy yeah  so in furiosa Mad Max Saga you play the  role of dementus a powerful warlord who  you've described as a pretty horrible  person maybe this is a silly question  but is an actor known for being a Norse  god who always saves the day did you  find any sort of perverse joy in being  the bad guy this time around yeah a lot  it's a certain amount of restrictions  expectations when playing the hero  especially a superhero that you have to  abide by and stay within um and so to to  to play the villain is fun it's it's  just you kind of the shackles are off  and you're allowed to be a little more  unpredictable you allowed to you know  there not as many rules to follow so  creatively it was it was it was a lot  more fun yeah did you have a most  memorable Driving Experience on set like  what is it like to hop in these George  Miller minations and just Cruise the  Australian desert in a chariot bik yeah  it's uh like the real life version of  you know when you were a kid playing in  the backyard smashing trucks and cars  together you know the big monster truck  vehicle that I was in was insane and  loud and obnoxious and  awesome it was uh epic to say the least  yeah  [Music]  yeah seeing  double that's Char's play there we go I  remember you said that I'll remember you  said that yeah this is a it's going to  bite me in the ass literally I'll enjoy  it twice when you shoot something like  the 12 minute long one shot fight  sequence and extraction yeah how much of  that is rehearsed down to the smallest  movement and then how much of it happens  in the moment no with that stuff it's  like the necessity  required in order for everyone to stay  alive it has to be rehearsed down to the  the last beat you know um and you have  all your stunt performers and so on go  through all  the right versions the wrong versions  the sort of experimentation period they  bust themselves to pieces and then I  turn up and do my own stunts but they've  you know been narrowed into a pretty  safe Zone safer you know than it could  be um there still a bit of a leap of  faith but um a huge amount of prep  required um and then it's sort of a  orchestrated Controlled  [Music]  Chaos a little  bit nothing we can't handle we're on top  of it ask me some questions all right I  got you  so your naio series Limitless it kind of  reminds me of hot ones and that there's  this obvious hook but the Ambitions of  the show go so much deeper is there a  Stress Management tool that maybe you  learn that could possibly be useful for  us as we work our way through the wings  of death here I learned about box  breathing you know 4 seconds in 4  seconds hold 4 seconds out 4 seconds  hold but I'm not sure when you're  choking on a chilly if that comes into  play well I guess we could just put it  into practice and see what happens yeah  getting big over here  are you ready to move on here to Sauce  number four I am I am Lo Calientes  barbacoa all  right a little something mhm little  something little  [Music]  something yeah should be kind of sweet  oh there it is yeah little Smokey yeah  it's a creeper that one mhm yeah okay  M yeah but still locked in focus and  maybe I'm going to start box breathing  [Music]  [Laughter]  yeah that in itself is a challenge is  someone who clearly enjoys an adventure  what are examples of things that you  have to contractually agree not to do  when you're heading a billion dollar  movie franchise oh well yeah I mean it's  there's always a do sign the waiver and  you don't do this don't do that you  still kind of do secretly but I've had a  few moments I've had a few moments where  I've been doing those things and going W  this could cost me or the studio or  someone a lot of money if I was to get  injured right now and so when I was a  shooting extraction I was down in the  south of France surfing some pretty big  waves and um yeah a couple of times with  kind of underwater you know being rolled  on by sort of big 15t Surf and thinking  uh maybe I shouldn't be here right now  this is this is good to hold the  production uh for for the entirety of it  because I'll be dead well thankfully you  can still eat hot wings are you ready to  move on here to the halfway mark let's  do this yeah so here we have now's  Revenge  okay I feel like we're going to stop  pouring this on and dipping in I'm  familiar I'll I'll do it if you're yeah  we're halfway there and it feels like B  start popping bottles I love popping  bottles man have you used that  before have anyone ever pop bottles  before in the show we are oh let get  little we are in  Vegas  no God  yeah yeah still not bad though right  it's a good one I love that meow's  Revenge meow's Revenge Jesus  yeah all right so a lot of actors who  have been on this show have explained to  me the value of doing soap operas early  on in their career including your  Countryman Margot Robbie how if at all  did putting together almost 200 episodes  of Home and Away prepare you for what  was to come in Hollywood for me the the  technicality was the greatest thing how  to hit your mark how to learn lines on  the flight how to just be comfortable in  the setting with cameras and lights and  things pointing in your direction you  know um and but then you kind of there's  not some I wouldn't say bad habits but  there's a certain sort of default  position you get into in a sort of  comfort zone which I had to kind of get  out of my system when I first started  doing  [Music]  film let's just pop bottles all right  let's pop bottles how heavy you going to  go I'm going to kind of follow your lead  all right I'm just doing a few oh this  is a dangerous dangerous game we're  playing ah why do we do this oh there we  go it's kind of your idea do you do the  the  version do you ever rub it in your eye  by accident oh  my any hot sauce mistake you can make  this is a step up by the way oh that's a  real jump that's not like a gentle  introduction we went  from pepper to chili now  but can't reach for the milk yet all  right all right yeah we're in a standoff  and I'll hold my ground as long as you  hold your ground in this together yeah  go for it go for  it when you're  watching can we have a glass of milk  let's do it it's too soon don't too all  right I'm off I'm off I'm off go I'm  always curious how people who act in  films actually consume them like how  would you describe yourself as a movie  goer uh I think a lot more growing up  you you know um I to love the movie  going experience but uh I don't know  once you're kind of seene behind the  curtain you can't help but sit there and  kind of hey I know they did this I know  that person drinks with that person and  you know when I watched Fury Road I  remember coming out of that film I was  completely immersed in the experience  for the first time in years I forgot  that I I I knew what was going on I  wasn't oh how did they do that shot how  did they do this I was absolutely 100%  absorbed in the experience and so  um I forgotten the question cuz there  kind my tongue I know yeah is that the  answer it works for me you know what I  mean like I'm I'm marinating in this  whole experience just like you you know  I'm no super marinating in the old uh  Ona cabanero Sher it's a challenge over  here let's have another one yeah you  want to you want to pop the bottle on it  yeah let's pop the bottle all right hell  yeah  [Music]  we're pushing the envelope aren't we do  we just bite it first or we no we didn't  no we  didn't all  right okay ready yep  okay kind of nice up front yeah almost  kind of ketchupy yeah but sometimes hot  sauce is tricky you know yeah this one I  think is a trickster L you and  then you have that sense of  security it's got like a peppery kick  doesn't it  yeah it does oh man yeah really like a  really a compliment to the last one you  know just a different kind of pepper  viol beautiful compliment yeah they're  all getting along in there aren't they  they really are complimenting each other  it's like a fish fight uhhuh like a war  zone do you have a go-to deflection when  you're at a convention and a fan  approaches you and asks you like a  minute super deep cut comic book  question that you have absolutely no  idea how to  answer  um no I've been pretty open about kind  of having read some Comics but not  others I do this thing sometimes when  I'm not real good with names everyone's  going to know now if there this but  someone come up and go Chris good to see  you and I let my wife with me I go  hey and she'll go hi I'm Elsa this is  John John this is sorry man something  like I could I could do that yeah I was  going to say I wasn't sure if you were  like telling the story and uh yeah  explaining or if you just actually  reacting to this be like hey good to see  you sorry and then you wipe for someone  else to step in smart I might steal that  from you you're good yeah it's not too  bad I mean it's it's not fun and Fades  right yeah now this next one is no fun  this is the bomb Beyond  Insanity yeah do we really want to pour  it on this pup bottles okay again  yeah I'm going to just pour in the Alisa  sace how's that sound oh dangerous is  you a mouth bouldering yeah and my lips  are on fire yeah should we have some  milk if you're down if you don't want to  I don't want to if you don't yeah good  if I'm good if you're good up to you I'm  not touching the milk into you touch it  yeah yeah well if you're good I'm good  you know no need for to reach for the  milk yeah it just doesn't go away either  does it no like speaking of compound  injuries you know what I mean like  that's the show you have a cumulative  effect here can't wait for the rest of  my press and interviews how going to do  for the  [Laughter]  day might be done oh my gosh yeah this  might be it this might take us out this  one really yeah you know I've been  around the block at do we always get to  the end oh you've been it before yeah  we're going to get to the  end now this one will be immediate bro  as soon as it hit my  I don't want to play  anymore I don't want to do this  anymore F had a nickel for every time I  heard that I think we have to do milk  right all right let's go let's go let's  go let's break the damn oh my  God  [Music]  yeah that's that's so bad I know and you  the milk doesn't even  really now I'm  nervous no I get it I get it  no I can't it want  stop no I get it I get it but as intense  as it is right now is as intense as it  will be you know what I mean it'll  fade oh no I'm I'm scared yeah no I get  it I get  it we're so braz before what I do  remember early on when you're like I'm  bored you know what I mean I'm not bored  no  more it always comes back this show oh  my God so you called surfing one of the  few things that holds my attention  completely and in its entirety no I'm  really nervous if I were to ask you  what's the greatest wave you've ever  surfed is there a memory that  crystallizes in your  brain well uh  man okay  okay  mhm um uh  clab  [Music]  right I went with um Kelly slider once  to clab Rak Fiji and uh ice cream  here here we go we have this magic trick  this is our medic over  here and that is  helpful it takes me down they got their  huge set he go don't worry that's the  last big set dropping off cool a paddle  out  and straight away the 12T set comes  through watch everyone out comes up he  looks at me goes I swear it's dropping  off that's the last big set and  uh 10 minutes later another one even  bigger my board's like tombstoning and  I'm like on the roef going trying to  climb my leg rope to get the top I come  up and he's like okay not get smaller go  in and winning that was probably the  biggest scariest surf of  nowhere near as terrifying as the next  thing we're about to  do  okay I can't wait to enjoy that tomorrow  morning it's just karma for all the  Cockiness I had at the start wasn't it  it's a humbling show you know it really  is at it's heart I wanted to stop there  have somewhere to go though it's a been  a journey it's a journey here we  go my budd's like why are we doing that  oh mine too mine too what an experience  oh my God  yeah actually just is bad it's not as  bad not fun but not as bad not as bad St  being sunburnt and sunburn again and  then skin peels off and you got sun  again do you remember where you were and  how you celebrated back in 2016 when  your beloved Western Bulldogs won the  AFL Grand Final their first in over 60  years yeah it was yeah was was there  with I was there with my dad and uh the  last time they' won was 1954 when he was  born careful careful  careful and uh super emotional this  story was  1954 and that's the last time that won I  said  that and  uh look at me I'm locked in  and I was at the Grand Final and it was  epic and every week up in in the finals  leading up everyone was like wow you  know the Bulldogs have gotten this far  they're not going to win they're a seven  seed you know that's incredible and  they're like they're not going to win  but you know this is so great and then  right at the game everyone said well we  got we got this far and I said we're  going to win we're going to do it and um  I remember my dad crying and and know  I'm having tears cuz he's crying and and  my brothers were there  and and it was it was epic it was great  it was so much  fun what we doing we dropping are we  doing this why are we doing this I don't  care let's  go a come on we come this far is this  the biggest worst one yeah that's the  show it's just like it's like surfing  with kie Slater you know right one wave  goes through you think it's going to be  the worst one and then the next one  comes you know oh man thankfully I'll  put too much on this is the last one  really love you love you  back goodbye  [Music]  goodbye uhoh oh and just one more  question before we roll credits it  almost seems pre-ordained that you'd be  an action star

anything like me  you're probably still reeling from That  season 23 finale with Conan O'Brien  chugging hot sauce spewing milk and  bringing in Dr Royo for some suspect but  very affordable medical advice and here  at hot ones we're more motivated than  ever 24 seasons in to keep raising that  bar and to do that we need our carefully  curated diabolically spicy lineup of  sauces so here they are the season 24  starting 10 and to kick things off after  a nice long run with hot ones buffalo  sauce we return to a classic the classic  garlic Fresno in the leadoff spot the  classic garlic Fresno has that familiar  combo of tarton Tangy vinegar A Fistful  of garlic and fresh Fresno chilies from  smoking EDS Fields it goes with just  about everything so for us it's the  perfect sauce to kick things off and  then in number two when you're thinking  about a perfect sauce a jalapeno based  sauce is kind of the perfect thing to  get that engine revving right before  things really kick off and that's  exactly what we do at number two with  seeing double not only does it taste  great with its mix of herbs and a hint  of sweetness but it will also make you  feel good knowing that proceeds from  double Comfort Foods support hunger  relief Charities all right moving on to  Sauce number three Mark's fermented  kimchi this sauce right here takes the  salty flavors the sour the sweet the  spiciness of kimchi harnesses it all  into this very funky number three sauce  rather than the standards like jalapeno  and haban Arrow this heat is built up  with fresh tii chilies and a splash of  soy sauce which helps pull everything  together into balance if you're not a  dieh hard fan of kimchi you will be  after adding this sauce to your rotation  All Right Moving On In just in time for  the season of grilling it is barboa the  smokiest of our Los Cente sauces in the  four spot featuring Applewood smoked rad  jalapenos plus a dash of habanero it  adds the perfect flame kissed flavor to  the fourth wing all right moving on to  Sauce number five the halfway mark right  here we have fatat gourmet's chairman  meow's Revenge featuring the Trinidad  Scorpion pepper now here's a fun fact  about Trinidad scorpion peppers is they  are sometimes mixed into paint and then  painted on the bottom of boat holes to  prevent Barnacles from growing that may  sound aggressive for a number five sauce  and let's be honest it is but fatat  gourmet's recipe balances the creeping  heat of scorpions with a tasty Trifecta  of garlic cilantro and lime juice there  you have it the front half of the lineup  and moving on to the back half if you  like fermented sauces season 24 is the  lineup for you unlike any season lineup  before it onot number six our first ever  hot sauce from Spain brings the funk  thanks to aged habanero peppers along  with notes of Sherry vinegar garlic and  paprika do you remember when ludicrous  talked about Dynamic Simplicity this  right here is dynamic Simplicity in hot  sauce form all right moving moving on to  number seven a little bit of a pirate  theme we can't help it it's in our DNA  swashbuckling sensibilities have always  been a part of hot ones and that is why  I'm attracted to this scorching number  seven sauce black eyed Susan's red flag  brings sweetness from mustine grape  juice and raspberries which can barely  contain the heat of scorpion peppers  which will have our guests feeling  Shipwrecked battered beaten but there is  no rest for the weary in this lineup  because up next holding its position as  it has forever the Legacy hot sauce in  the lineup the bomb Beyond Insanity it's  back at this point all the supplemental  oxygen has been kicked you're delirious  and battered by the elements but there's  nothing left to do but ride the  adrenaline put one foot in front of the  other and as you continue to climb the  altitude gets higher and so do the  Scoville at number nine High Rivers  Peppers up Peppers up features smoking  ads elusive Apollo pepper which is the  star of the show in this number nine  sauce from hot ones vet High River but  with this sauce where there's pain  there's pleasure thanks to a mix of tart  berries brown sugar and Yuzu that can  excite the pallet before another  punishing wave of spice washes over you  to close things out holding on at the  end of The Gauntlet is the last AB  experience made with the world record  holding hottest pepper in the world  pepper X smoking Ed worked his magic to  distill his Infamous mutant chili into  this pure pepper concoction made up of  over 91% pepper X and its pure dried  fresh in all natural distillate forms  and there you have it another spice  Symphony to fuel season 24 of our show  thank you so much for watching and  supporting

      "page_content": "ah I hate my J I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter Wings this is  yeah you go to  hell you led me into that he really  burning my lips up here the lime does  that  work hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we close out season 9 with Stone  Cold Steve Austin he's a six-time WWF  World Heavyweight Champion and WWE Hall  of Famer you can catch him on the  award-winning podcast the Steve Austin  show and he also has a new TV show it's  called straight up Steve Austin catch it  Mondays 11:10 Central after Monday Night  Raw on the USA Network Stone Cold  welcome to the show glad to be here man  it's uh going to be hell of an  extravagan I don't know what I've just  gotten myself into but I'm ready to go  with you well I know that you're an Edna  Texas boy how do you handle your spice  man in my environment back in the day I  was the toughest SOB in the history of  the WWE here in front of you I might be  the biggest [ __ ] you've ever had on the  show that remains to be seen and that's  what we're about to find out  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  oh it's already on there  [Music]  okay see that's  [Music]  good so as a show that forces scorching  not chicken wings on our guest were  super interested in this movement  towards experiential celebrity  interviews do you think all those years  clicking with wrestlers in the ring do  you think that gives you an advantage  when it comes to building chemistry with  a TV show or podcast guest you know  being Stone Co Ste Austin back in the  day a lot of people think uh man this  guy's a little bit wound up he's a  little bit over the edge he's crazy you  know he's always mad he drinks a lot I  drink a little bit but uh I I I enjoy  meeting people I enjoy talking to people  and and uh I'm curious by Nature the  more you do something the better better  you get at it so I'm hoping this season  catches on so I can apply what I've  learned this season into another season  and to keep doing keep going from there  but I don't I don't think being a WWE  Superstar necessarily you know made me  unnatural at  [Music]  it I like the gradual kind of mild up  your we've got several to go here I like  what you're doing  here I know that there's the method to  your Madness and I've enjoyed watching  the shows that I've watched oh thank you  you've seen it so you do kind of know  what you're getting yourself into here  absolutely  so being a global icon and a national  treasure the mythology around Stone Cold  Steve Austin it's so vast so I think  that it's only right early on in the  interview that we clear the air on some  of the lore surrounding the Texas  rattlesnake Factor fiction before you  decided on Stone Cold the WWF gave you a  list of possible nicknames that included  Fang mcross Chile mcfreeze and Otto von  ruthless true this is way back in the  day I was living on 10 acres in a log  cabin outside Georgia and I was watching  a special on HBO about Richard klinsky  who was a serial killer he was a hitman  and I'm not endorsing anything he did  but he was just ruthless individual so I  said okay there's some traits there that  would make a good villain in the squared  Circle so I pitched the idea to the  office and the Iceman had already been  done at a local level down in Dallas by  Iceman King Parson so we didn't want to  go down that road and So based on you  know the my concept that I gave them  they pitched me temperature B names it  wasn't about being temperature based  it's coldblooded you know like mean  remorseless ruthless and so I was like  you got to be kidding me this is a  creative genius it's WWE I mean they're  supposed to make anybody uh and  everybody and turn them into a superstar  so the names were absolutely ridiculous  and I could not believe that that was  the best that they came up with is there  any truth to the rumor that 100 plus  beers were consumed during that beer  bash in Japan with Stacy keer and The  Dudley that is true now actually all the  way consumed 12 O portions I don't know  but spilled I I I had it about  128 I think it's still a record but you  you come out of a session like that and  like people say hey man you wasted most  that damn beer that's the showbest part  of it if I was just to sip it all and  just drink it all it'd be a horrible  visual so you got to get some on you but  I'll tell you there's been I don't know  how many times I would come out of that  ring and you'll leave with a bus because  you go in there with empty belly and  guzzle all that beer you going to get a  bus Factor fiction you and Booker T  caused $10,000 worth of damage to a  grocery store brawling that is indeed  what I heard the total damage was I  believe that was called the green frog I  think it was in Fresno California if I'm  not mistaken I think the store closed  down after not not because of that but  after that and we had an absolute blast  uh Booker and I have always had a  chemistry going back from our days in  Atlanta when we both both work for WCW  he's one of the funniest guys I know and  I just had him on my podcast as a matter  of fact but yeah $10,000 worth of damage  was the uh sum total fact or fiction you  let the Caboose loose while wrestling  Yokozuna in South Africa had to a lot of  times when you do International tra when  you do an international travel and  there's a dietary change happened and  man yoke man he was weighing you know  600 pounds at the time and when he  picked me up and slammed me things  happened something went South and  luckily I was wearing black Trunks and  Yoko was so cool he's no longer with us  uh God Rest his soul but I was laying  there on the mat I just cracked my  trunks and I looked at him I said yoke  let's go home go home is is Russell  speak for let's do the finish and get  out of here and he's so cool he goes  okay  bro and we did the finish I got beat and  I walked to the back and took a hell of  a  [Music]  shower  shaquandas I don't want to be level  three to meet the one that makes me have  a Yokozuna moment here on your show this  a season finale but what a finish it  would be got stone cold out here in he  [ __ ] himself what's our language  parameters you can go Stone Cold unleash  here okay okay I don't want to go crazy  this is starting to get a little out  there I barely put a tongue on that  one and I know that you're a driver's ed  teacher as a senior at North Texas do  you have a biggest driving pet peeve  people don't use the blinkers number one  use your effing blinkers please I mean  you know and it's  like if someone if someone's driving a  car and it's real bad shape you think  okay well you know [ __ ] the blinker just  broke or the you know the light doesn't  work but then if it's someone in a real  nice car like a Mercedes or BMW think oh  he's just an [ __ ] he thinks he's  entitled and he's he doesn't have to use  his blinkers but that's my number one  pet peeve use your effing blinkers  please and then do you still have a  problem with rats on the ranch I know  for a while there there chewing up your  Chevy trucks and Polaris Rangers they  were a severe problem we never defeated  them uh I sold the ranch about 3 years  ago and we're now based out of Nevada of  course I'm now fortunate enough to be  driving Kawasaki mules and they don't  touch my mules because there's not as  many up there for some reason and we  have a bunch of cats anybody in South  Texas or in in the remote areas you know  are dealing with rats and they are a  real problem you go out there to fire up  your car sometimes it won't fire your  lights don't fire so you always keep the  hood up you know you put steel wool in  your tail pipes you do the things you  can do best thing is buy  cats Pro tips from Stone Cold Steve  Austin are you ready to move on to  number four yeah you're reading me  Emma in your eyes I can see it look at  him wait boy you going to stare down  while he's taking a bite out of his  wings this ain't his first rodeo is this  going to be the one that gets me m oh  so I know that you're a true student of  professional wrestling and you're always  very generous with your praise for those  who've come before you and after pound  for pound who was the most physically  impressive athlete during your wrestling  days Dynamite Kid back in his day was  very Cutting Edge just a snap suplexes  diving off the top ropes I mean he was  really Innovative the way he did things  the way he executed things in the ring  he would be be someone that I would put  on a list that I I highly respect Ed  besides yourself who had the best mic  skills during the Attitude Era you you  can not Overlook The Rock when he first  arrived on the scam he was just  good-looking you know third generation  baby face and just people just didn't  take to him and it was a DI Roy die die  Rocky D and they put him in the nation  of domination and he ascended to the top  of that organization and he started  wearing the the silk shirts and he  started referring to himself in third  person and working that eyebrow and he  electrified and captivated crowds with  his catchphrases his Cadence and his  delivery and his message and calling  everybody Jabron Knowing Your Role so  yes I was an outstanding promo in my own  right and had my own style but Rock  commanded uh the audience's respect  attention and elicited the response that  he was looking for from them who had the  most insane pre-match  ritual I don't know who had the most  insane but who had the simplest was Jake  The Snake Roberts because just back in  the day when he carried the snake in the  bag the the snake would be laying on on  say a trash can with a flat top or maybe  on the floor and Jake would be walking  around he never went to the gym and he'd  be smoking a cigarette and all sudden  theyd hit Jake's  music he'd take a final drag off that  cigarette crush it out with his foot  throw the snake over his back and just  walk to the ring no warm up no nothing  that's how he did it dragging on a  cigarette and once Jake got in the ring  he commanded your respect and he had  this presence about him and he's one of  the most economic efficient workers out  there where he didn't do a whole lot but  everything he did meant something and he  was always working for that DDT so he  was phenomenal in that right but the  Simplicity of his warm-up routine would  stand out more than the the craziest  routine that I can think of  [Music]  all right St coold we have a recurring  segment on our show called explain that  gram where we do a deep dive on our  guest Instagram pull interesting  pictures that need more contact so I'll  bust out the laptop I'll show you the  picture you just tell me the bigger  story does that sound good yep all  [Music]  right here you are doing some work on  the ranch in all your years in ranching  have you ever flipped a tractor been  bitten by a snake when you think about  Broken Skull in the near emergencies is  there a story that stands out there's a  couple times when we're mowing uh the  ponds we would call them tanks in Texas  a water hole the the embankments are  pretty damn Steep and I used to work for  the highway department when I was a kid  you know so I be used to driving on the  overpasses and stuff like that on the  sides of Highways but there's there's a  kind of a pucker Factor we'd call it and  you're you're dragging uh a 15t Batwing  Shredder behind you which kind of gives  you a little bit of a low center of  gravity or keeps you anchored to the  ground but just the fact that if you hit  a a hog waller or something like that  you just know that that tractor's going  to flip over and your ass is going to be  upside down in the water and ain't  nobody going to get you out of there so  many many near cases of that are just  pucker Factor uh never got bit by a  rattlesnake I heard a few and they have  a very distinct rattle when you're  walking to your deer stand and all of a  sudden one starts rattling at you and  it's kind of like that come to Jesus  moment and I don't hear very well but  you I can hear damn rattlesnake you know  like like it's nobody's  business what do you remember about  meeting Muhammad Ali Paul lorf is the  guy right there to the to the left side  of that picture he actually took a pair  of boxing gloves to get Muhammad Ali to  sign them but Muhammad Ali was simply  the greatest boxer that ever lived in  such a charismatic personality that he  had this Global worldwide following of  people who absolutely loved him I've  never met anybody that said anything bad  about Muhammad Ali because he was just  universally loved by literally everyone  so it was really cool to remember that I  met the goat sip of tequila for The  Working Man do you have a go-to  margarita recipe oh yeah so basically  I'm working with a 3 oz shot glass got  it I go Patrone silver just because you  can go a a higher grade tequila that's  going to be a lot smoother but you going  to need a little bit of bite in that  Margarita so 3 oz of tequila they pour  this in a Shaker about an ounce to an  ounce and a half of triple SE about an  ounce to ounce and a quar of lime juice  people get carried away with lime juice  most time when you go to restaurants and  you give you something that's just  tastes like limeade and it just kills  you no can do that's the biggest mistake  rookies make or bartenders that don't  know their [ __ ] with the margarita just  a spray of a agave nectar just a few  drops  so you shake that up in a Shaker right  and then you pour it out on Fresh rocks  and then you float about an ounce of  grandar on top and that's the Broken  Skull Ranch Margarita and each one you  drink is a triple so by the time you  drank two of my Margaritas that's six  shots of tequila you're good yeah now  I'm not good but but you would be  good heating up hting up so when you  were chatting with Hulk Hogan on your  podcast recently you guys are talking  about wrestling in Japan and how crazy  it was in the' 70s why does that era why  does that scene why does that have such  a special place in wrestling Insider  Hearts just going back to the old Japan  Days that's when it was really kind of  still considered a shoot you know  walking back to the dressing room many  times you know like in Kansas City  Harley Race you know there there's guys  you know stories of guys getting stabbed  and Gaff you know by knives from fans  because they were so you know bought  into the fact of what they were seeing  if the heels were getting heat or you  know beating up the the good guys and  they really cared about those good guys  hell man A lot of times those bad guys  had to fight their way to the dressing  room and so that's it's those old Japan  Days memories like that that hearken up  those fond memories of what the business  really was in its core what were the  fans in Osaka like compared to say a  soldout crowd at the Dallas bort terium  if you're working in front of a Japan  crowd and you're from the States they're  very they're very quiet and certain  things make them come or fire up  differently than a state side crowd  would be so like uh maybe these two guys  working it's complete silence and one of  them has a submission hold on the other  one and that one guy gets to the ropes  oh they'll start they they'll pop for  that or if a guy's starting to getting  kind of shelled on then all of a sudden  he just comes up with this fire and  starts you know responding that gets  that crowd so much different from an  from an audible level of Storytelling by  listening to the crowd I don't hear very  well but w you put me in an arena full  of 20,000 people if the sun [ __ ] up  there in row 100's booing and everybody  else is chearing I know exactly where  he's at and I and I'm not I'm not  worried about him but I'm just saying  that's how in tuned I am with the crowd  because you're always reading a crowd  whether you're going by the script that  everybody talks is talking about or  you're calling it on the Fly you're  listening to that crowd because if  you're not working that crowd you're  doing it wrong  [Music]  hell I watched Shaq come over here and  boy he was sweating bullets and Gordon  Rams he was dropping F bombs everywhere  and look at you well like I said I think  there's a setup  here if those guys cuz I I I haven't got  a chance I'd love to meet Gordon Ramsey  I met Shaq a few times but Shaq was  really but he said he wasn't going to  show any faces he he did pretty good he  maintained his composure but he started  sweating  [Music]  it's like people think going say  something profound here I was actually  timing my heartbeat I'm thinking  something's about to go wrong here your  my heartbeat hits about 150 something's  wrong these aren't laced with  amphetamines are they no no yeah I'm  enging my I'm I'm checking my my  biological and phys olical responses as  you're sitting there looking at me we've  got them hooked up to the Biometrics  over here okay uh yeah that that one's  starting to get there yeah yeah that one  starting to get there I I know I can go  one deeper but that one I'm feeling that  one M yeah what you got for me so as a  guy who Embraces the Simple Pleasures  but also as an appreciation for the  things that are badass I know that  you're very proud of the project you've  done with eligo Brewing Company Broken  Skull IPA are you of the belief that the  beer you drink says something about the  person yes it does and I stand by that  beer I I worked on that beer sitting at  a table just like this very much like  this with Rob CAW the owner of ela guno  Bru company and we decided to  collaborate on a beer we had 10 to 15  beers on the table that we both liked  and or fancied or or had some quality to  them and so as we were drinking these  beers I would explain to him and I don't  really necessarily speak beer  terminology but I'm a pretty good expert  at drinking beer and I would explain  okay this is hitting me mid I like some  a little bit more mid pallet some of  them hit you too too up front or some  linger too long some are too bitter and  I would explain the way each beer uh  affected me or where it resonated with  me on my taste buds and I was so proud  to be down there in Tamp at that raw  reunion and I got a good buzz and I was  proud to be drinking my freaking beer  after all these years of drinking  everybody  else's I want to do this for the people  for season  9 boy B the sales pitch never heard one  we we got to do it for the people we do  we're in it together we're in this  together oh Jesus you should have been a  wrestling promoter I would have loved to  do that  H my damn nose is running and I haven't  even got it close to my mouth  yet how is it oh man my Lo have  bured all right I'll do it I got to  [Music]  I'm showing my range here anybody just  take a bite out of it's  like no but you know what I want to ask  you something sure I'm kidding you I'm  just [ __ ] with  you I'm timing my heart rate mhm you  ever had anybody come out here in time  heart rate you're the first one nine  Seasons deep and you're the first one  I'm unique some people Tom me [ __ ] up  I like to say unique it sounds better so  one of my favorite things about  listening to the Steve Austin show is  hearing you and other wrestlers talk  shop and trade War Stories from your  years in the business and I've come to  figure out that wrestling lingo is the  best kind of lingo what does color  mean color means blood what is cheap  heat cheap heat is if you and me are  working a match and I'm the bad guy and  I were to spit on you that that's cheap  heat because anybody could have done  that what do you mean when you say  calling high spots say a high spot is  you know now we need some motion we need  to do something to elicit response  tackle drop down hip toss if I have you  in the headlock you're going to shoot me  off you're going to take the  tackle I'm going to run a ropes you'll  drop down I'm going to jump over you and  then you're going to hip toss me on the  way back so a high spot is movement  within the match what's a receipt a  receipt is I'll give you a great story  if you lay something in too hard then  the other person's got to send you a  receipt that says hey dude settle down  so anyway a long time ago I was working  with the big boss man ray trailer Ray  trailer is about 66 300 lb he was a  former you know prison guard and that  was his gimmick Big Boss Man and Ray hit  me with about six lefts you know and  referee Earl hner is kind of sitting  there watching he's kind of got this  shitty and gr on his face he's kind of  smiling because he knows I'm only going  to take a few more so finally I decided  I've had enough so I picked up Ray again  Ray 66 about 300 some odd PBS I sent him  into the ropes and I told him I said  watch a clothes line so when I tell a  guy watch a clothes line normally you're  going to hit a guy right here you don't  want to hit him in Adam's Apple you just  want to hit him here with enough Force  so through through his axis a pivot  point he can take his bump and land on  his  back here comes Ray 66 well I decided  you know this was receipt I'm not going  to give him a clothesline what I did I  baled up my fist like that with my  forearm and as he was coming I bam I hit  him right between the eyes of my forearm  with everything I had and big Ray went  down and he's on his hands and knees and  on his hands on his knees he's damn near  as tall as I am and but he looked up at  me like this and it was almost like a  Saturday morning cartoon with stars  going around his uh head like this and  he has a smile on his face cuz he knew  he [ __ ] up and he goes okay and he was  recognized in the fact that I gave him a  receipt and he didn't T off on me for  the rest of the night all right Stone  Cold hold on we goddamn heart rate's  about  [Music]  130 I'm still in the safe Zone I should  have wor my heart rate monitor  so this is tell me about this one this  is the chocolate  plague from puckerbutt pepper  company see did you need to know all  that well it tells me what's going to  happen tomorrow okay I was trying to  give you my receipt story and that some  B was kicking my ass so I gave you that  I tell that story in a much better  fashion but my mouth was on fire so I  didn't get there that was  great is is milk my friend at this point  milk's your  friend siping milk for the work  man is this going to be hotter than  enough soach I just  ate it will  not you're such a  liar I wouldn't lie to you I'd be an  idiot to lie to you in this situation  but is it is it going to compound the  fact that I've got a residual this  building I think that we're already past  the point of no return you know it's  like we've we've been drenched in a  shower who cares if it  rains I know it shouldn't but I'm going  to  [Music]  and I'm not I'm not a hot  person could have fooled me you're doing  [Music]  great do you have a favorite WWE Raw  Cameo from a non wrestler the Mike Tyson  stuff was always very compelling I love  doing business Mike when he came down  and V man introduced him a long time ago  in the middle of the ring and he was  going to referee the match between  myself and Sean Michaels at Wrestlemania  14 and I came down there and got in his  face flipped him off and he pushed me  and I tried to get back at him and I was  trying as we would say going back to  wrestling for a shoot to get back at him  of course I didn't want want to get back  at him but it had to look real and it  was but when he pushed me all of these  $100 bills just flew out of his suit if  you go back on YouTube watch it and  you'll watch all of his handlers down on  hands and knees picking up $100 bills  and I'm kicking and scratching and  Brisco Slaughter all the guys are  holding me back but work with Mike Tyson  because he's such a a fan of the  business and a historian of the business  and he actually probably knew more about  the history of the business than a lot  of the guys that were backstage but just  him him by himself as a person I just  love the guy all right Stone  Cold  [Music]  oh this is the last dab we call it the  the last dab because it's tradition  around here to put a little extra on the  last Wing you don't have to if you don't  want to I love the way just toss it up  to me so I can either puss out or go  down swinging with you you sorry son of  a  [ __ ] hang on there you  go tell me what I'm about to get myself  into well it's describe death to me tell  me what I'm about to get myself into  Grim Reaper here's not saying I think  that you have gone you know we're  approaching the peak you know of this  spice Mountain that we're climbing  together yes and I don't see a drop of  sweat on you you know I've I've I've  stared across this table for so many  crazy things from people doing laps to  spitting in buckets to pouring milk up  their nose to dumping water over their  head and you are just calm cool and  collected telling amazing wrestling  stories and pounding chicken it's it's  absolutely a sight to behold and it's a  lovely segue to this last question okay  what is it  first we  Feast got to be spreaded on there yeah  there you go better  remove you want to do this together yeah  Cheers Cheers  Steve all right Stone Cold Steve Austin  here we are at the end of our tag team  match against the wings of death but  before we go just one more finishing  move before they hit the bell I know  that you take a lot of pride in your  ability to cut a promo and for good  reason you're one of the best who's ever  done it and then that Austin 316 it's  still a household catchphrase some 25  years later so with that in mind I'm  curious what is your message to the  people out there including some on your  old team who thought that you'd get  suplex today by the wings of  death I watched Gordon Ramsey I watched  Shaq and those guys were sweating  bullets and cussing and raising all  kinds of hell so for me to be able to  Wing this no pun intended have a  wonderful sit down conversation with you  who obviously does a shitload of  research was one of the defining moments  of my entire life wow well I am humbled  beer me  [Music]  Chris a toast to season 9 and to you  Stone Cold Steve Austin thank you for  having me on my on your show and  congrats on nine Seasons I hope I can  get nine out of straight up Steve Austin  well now you know what Steve there's  nothing left to do but roll out the

hot questions and even hotter wings  and today we're joined by Millie Bobby  Brown she's an actress and producer know  best from her role as 11 on the seven  time Emmy awardwinning Global Mega hit  show stranger things which returns for  its highly anticipated fourth season on  Netflix May 27th Millie Bobby Brown  welcome to the show thank you very much  I'm very excited to be here well how are  you around spicy food I know that the  mads that you eat on set from crafty  Dave you like to hit them with a little  hot Sriracha I do I do I um I was also  born in Spain so I'm very familiar with  spicier foods but I'm I'm quite nervous  in all honesty it's very  [Music]  nerve-wracking can I ask you a question  anything you want if I drink this does  it mean I've given up no no no you know  this we want it to be like the most  comfortable least comfortable interview  if that makes sense so if you need some  milkshake why does it already smell  spicy my nostrils like I have no more  hairs left okay where are we starting at  the uh at the handle over here with the  classic garlic Fresno so to your yep  perfect okay  [Music]  do we have a little surprise here to  open things up for Wing one we do have a  surprise wow Noah hello Noah I'm glad to  be here on the spot giving us a little  assist here for Wing one so is this this  is the mild one mhm yep okay you lucked  out you picked a good time to come in  cheers  Noah really good wi no by the way she  was saying that she's so good at spice I  know we'll find out today I'm much  better with spice well they didn't  invite you on  show but I'm happy to be here for it's  not spicy is it all right now go watch  me kill this all right there we go got  the support hit in the  milkshake great  job hand right  there so the scene is set for the season  4 premiere of stranger things which The  Duffer Brothers have ominously described  as being the show's Game of Thrones  season what made shooting this season in  your words the hardest one you've ever  filmed I mean mostly because we filmed  for 3 years especially with the amount  of filming that we had to do we were  filming in three different places we  were filming in Lithuania New Mexico and  Atlanta and it was difficult yeah I  think that's yeah how's that first Wing  fine doing great yeah are you ready to  move on here to the next Wing yes this  right here is the adobo Loco Wing sace a  little bit of like an island Vibe with  this one okay  [Music]  nice really nice so stranger things  isn't the only big project that you have  on the way with the Nola Holmes 2 coming  out soon a sequel to the acclaimed 2020  film that you not only starred in but  also produced between the writing the  casting and all the different aspects of  a production was there anything that you  found felt most natural to you or where  you felt you could make the biggest  impact as a producer producing felt  really natural to me because I could  still create on and off camera so I  could you know go onto set and do my  thing but also creatively change the  script and go into editing and it was it  was a really cool position and it  actually made me feel the most  comfortable I felt in in any set  situation because I felt like I  could I don't know express myself  through fully in my creative process  from uh Gothic Victorian dresses to  school uniform disguises pound-for-pound  what do you think was the best fit in  the whole Lola Holmes project from a  pure costume design perspective  M I love my red dress I think my red  dress is really cool and it symbolizes  you know this masculine kick ass girl  who knows her jiujitsu but also can cut  see when she needs to I think it's  really  sweet is this is this one  e it gets a little it gets a  [Music]  little a little more real  here  mhm yep I'm feeling  it was there anything that you found  interesting or amusing about learning  the Midwest accent for stranger things I  asked because I'm from Illinois oh  really yeah what I will say is that The  Duffer brothers who created the show  definitely have that kind of accent  they're not like whiny but they  definitely say y'all and things like  that do you say y'all no I don't say  y'all but like you know also like milk  you know like sometimes I feel like  guests can hear the draw coming from me  and then they're like well where are you  from and I'm like Illinois and then  they're like of course we know  why are there British accents that you  think should get more play in Hollywood  I love a liver pudan accent anyone from  Liverpool is sounds I can't do the  accent so don't ask me I won't I won't  but I support the football team  Liverpool and they have a really big FA  Cup win by the way I know we're very  we're very proud um I love a liid puddle  and  accent what is this flavor this is like  a like a Sano pepper kind of green  sauce oh that one's nice you like that  one M there we go I do like that one am  I getting progressively  shinier I hope not yeah you have the  nice hot ones  that we like to see at this point  the so when we had Rob low on the show  he described eating on camera as being  one of the most difficult actor tricks  of all time what are the forces at play  that Mak shooting a scene in which your  character is wolfing down diner food or  Eggo Waffles by the Dozen what makes  those scenes for an actor so much more  difficult than an audience May realize  because you're doing it for 12 hours so  usually what you do is you just get a  little bucket beside you and you can  just spit into it after every take or  sometimes during the take but most of  the time I just  go and then just pretend I'm eating  which always kind of works um but other  than that yeah you just start to feel  really nauseous it's horrible and  whatever you choose to eat on that plate  you're eating for 12 hours so usually I  always choose like a salad or a fruit M  it works and then on the topic we talked  about one of your favorite snacks the  Maad what is a Maad and can you talk me  through how to make one if I wanted to  try it for myself oh yes okay so what we  do is we get a a piece of lettuce and we  get cut up ham peppers and then we get  sriracha and we cover the whole kind of  sandwich in it and then they usually  make me like six of them and that is  what keeps me going on set it's the best  ever with no fuel by mards fueled yeah  and and I think it's the last name of  the guy who makes it that's why we call  it Mard crafty Dave crafty Dave shout  out to crafty Dave all right you are  doing so good by the way thank you we  are to the halfway point are you ready  to move on here to number five yeah so  this is the seventh Reaper here at  [Music]  5 that one's also nice it's nice I like  it here we go I'm feeling pretty good  God I thought this would be a lot worse  than I thought well do you start to feel  it do you start to feel it soon it does  get a little crazier in the back half  but you are crushing this okay you're  absolutely crushing this good I'm not  saying that I'm not feeling it but it's  not making me want to cry like Tom  Holland is that bad okay good we haven't  even hit the milkshakes yet I know  should can we can I try it sure sure I'm  just wanting to try  it oh this is good where do we get this  from Five Guys Five Guys also why do  Five Guys not put their chips in a thing  they always just put it in the bag don't  they oh right right yeah just the fries  just hanging loose in the loose in the  bag why are there peanuts in there like  who eats peanuts anyways all right all  right Millie we have recurring segment  on our show called explain that gram  where we do a deep dive on our guest  Instagram pull interesting pictures that  need more contact so we'll pull the  picture up over here on the monitor you  just tell us the bigger story what was  the highlight of the afternoon you spent  ripping laps with Louis Hamilton at the  circuit of America uh I got to do a hot  lap with  him oh little teas yeah Spin and we got  to go around the  RAC trck and it was amazing it was a  really cool experience very terrifying  almost as terrifying as this one but it  was really cool and this moment was when  we were about to get in the car so you  see I'm a bit nervous yeah yeah but then  just like this show you get down in the  seat and then you just own it right  you've got to you've got to no one's  taking me  down all right up next for you besides  Godzilla actually being a tennis ball  you're delivering lines to what blew  your mind most about the technical  Wizardry that goes into making a kaiju  blackbuster it's insane it's insane it  also takes longer to to to put Godzilla  in there than to actually film it they  are so unbelievably talented in that  field that they can you know it was he  was literally a tennis thought I  remember my neck hurting cuz I was  always looking up in that  film oh my God I'm nervous now you  telling me that I've got four more  left I just didn't get enough there you  go I don't want anyone to think I've  wimped  out so one of the unique elements of  stranger things is it seems like you and  your castmates have been given a deal of  creative input even from a young age is  there an example of an 11 character  trait or stranger things plot point that  you're proudest to have fought for put  your fingerprints on in some way yeah I  think this season that I I feel that the  most like with the bullying aspect of  what 11's going through I feel really  proud to represent that kind of  storyline because that's a very real  thing people do deal with that um in  school and I think you know it's a hard  thing to film for sure especially from  someone who has gone through bullying  but yeah I just feel I feel really proud  to have done that how would you grade  Hollywood's ability to harness young  people's creativity these days because  people have gone from being you know  just actors to now all of a sudden being  like showrunners and executive producers  at younger and younger  ages yeah I mean we're getting there we  are getting there I think that we have  amazing corporations say like Netflix  and legendary who have given me  opportunities to produce and to be part  of my projects collaboratively um not  only as a young person but a young girl  I think those types of things are  getting the ball rolling and pushing  Society to trust jenz and all that we  have to  offer it's not really psyching me out do  you know what it feels like have you  ever gotten a CT scan I have have I've  actually had and they put the die in you  yeah yeah that's what it feels like your  body just kind of gets all warm it's  fun so one of the Hallmarks of stranger  things is' 80s Nostalgia which has given  life through this meticulous commitment  to period pieces to period details  what's the first thing that you seem to  be choking up a bit here listen I  haven't just beat you on your own show  have I you listen it happens every once  in a while I'm but a a humbl chicken wi  talk show  I'm just out here trying my best we  appreciate that what's the first thing  that comes to mind when you think about  the obsessive level of detail that went  into a set piece to keep it authentic to  the period ooh we used a lot of  helicopters in our show we have to be  like we have to get a helicopter that's  basically from the'80s I think that's  insane that also goes up in the sky do  you know what I mean right that can  still do it yeah they can still do it or  they have to paint it to absolutely  replicate an 0s helicopter I think  that's pretty impressive to me the mall  to me was impressive as some the mall is  I mean that that attention to detail the  fact that it wasn't called Gap and it  was called The Gap like certain things  like that I'm like wow that's just it's  it's really cool all the clothes were  from the80s they all had tags on it from  the80s like it was all very very  nostalgic for my family my parents and  not really for me at all but it was  really cool to be in it it felt like you  were really in it and then I understand  that you know part of the uh requisite  homework was watching movies like The  Goonies or Poltergeist or Stand By Me  did you walk away from that experience  with uh film in particular that meant  the most to you I love ET ET reminds me  of 11 a lot because you  know  ET is this kind of thing that's come  down from a different planet it kind of  feels like 11's come down from this  different planet it doesn't know anyone  and trusts Elliot and I think El trusts  Mike and it's quite a nice you know  that's quite a nice  resemblance all right so this next one  is the bomb Beyond  Insanity a sauce that's reputation  precedes it just a little bit okay all  right and then this is this is one  that's like a prank but you're crushing  what do you mean like a  prank this one is just worse there's  just something about this one  [Music]  I  know that's not even normal no nothing  about it nothing about  it that like made me want to stop  breathing just hit that milkshake I did  so [ __ ] well you're still doing well  you're still crushing it no you're still  doing good no you know it's not every  day that we have a hot one's guest who  has their very own eyewear line what to  you is like fundamental or key when  pulling out a perfect pair of spectacles  or Shades  uh what one did Tom Holland cry at at  this one this  one I just need an ice cube in my mouth  yeah yeah  um well I really like C ey  sunglasses it's on my gums yeah  yeah tongue lips my hair is cooling  out I  really like cat eye  shapes well if you'll humor me what I  want to do is show you some pictures  from Iconic celebrity sunglass moments  from the past I'm just curious how they  hit your expert eye you know the things  that are working for you the things that  don't work for you and we'll start with  Elton John do you why did you do this to  me I'm only  18 I'm only  small do you have any thoughts on these  Shades from Elton John's P Wiz they're  so  great I love them what about this thumbs  up or thumbs way up on Missy Elliott's  super duper fly Crystal mask look I love  them they're great I love  that all right next up next why it's  like not getting better though I know I  know it's just going to grow a little  bit do you have a preference between the  risky business I don't like neither they  don't look nice I I don't like those  ones they don't suit me there we go  there we go one more for you before we  go last but not least your thoughts on  lady  2019 me yep it was a lovely look by her  I don't think I can do more is that one  worse don't try and talk me through this  tell me right now is the is that is that  ninth one bad it's not worse than the  last one is it going to make what I'm  feeling right now though the the after  effect of that one you led me into that  I don't think I ever trust you again  [Music]  no it's already burning my  nose whoo What do you mean wo no I just  I like this I just like the  determination know I  know I want to do this you got but I'm  telling you my my face doesn't feel like  my face I can feel feel my face when I'm  with you literally literally oh my God  we got it we got  it so I know that you have a a spiritual  connection with whales one saying that  they symbolize you as a person to quote  they're loud and they're queens of the  sea is there a a whale fun fact or a  quality that you see in whales that you  see most in yourself um humpback  whales humpback whales float and eat all  day girls and they all like to be  girls that one isn't good I yeah I know  I know do you want some ice no yes here  we go look it you want it we got it  thank you  ma'am there we go mhm there we go  mhm from your unique perspective  Godzilla destructive and rampaging sea  monster or misunderstood environmental  activist a misunderstood environmental  activist Che to that  [Music]  you don't have to if you don't want to  no why are you doing it you don't have  to prove anything you're great you're  great you're doing great yeah you know  what you're right I don't have to prove  anything no you don't you know I think  I'm so mechanical in like just going  through this all the time that I don't  stop to think about like yourself  there's no need for me to like spike the  ball in the end zone or whatever you  don't no you don't all right well you're  right I'm going to pop the top on you're  doing great tell me about your life  from Illinois 7 years ago no kids no  kids you don't want kids all right now  I'm mentally and emotionally younger  than  [Music]  you I know if I throw up

done I know I don't  need you to talk anymore I don't need  you to talk yeah stranger things  executive producer and director Sean  Levy he once said that you're able to  convey more without a word than many  actors convey with monologues so to  close things out I'll point to a hot  sauce you just React to what it was like  to eat that hot sauce purely in a facial  expression sure the one that we just ate  the last  da that oh how about the one that you  really liked uh Los Cent's  ver and then how about the one that uh  almost made you write me off forever the  bomb Beyond  Insanity that's what my insides were  doing not a dry eye in the house and  look at you Millie Bobby Brown taking on  the wings of death and living to tell  the tale and now there's nothing left to  do but roll out

the concrete below  I broke my uh cheekbone and I broke  seven teeth 10 stitches in my chin a  concussion and a broken wrist all in one  fall and I laid their face down with a  pool of blood growing around my head  there was a keg party on campus  everyone's like wow he's dead he's just  faith I wasn't even twitching a finger  and my buddies they knew I had the weed  in my pocket they said if he's not not  dead he's going to need that weed so  they came and like pulled it out of my  pockets like going through my pocket  going through the dead guy's Pockets to  take his weed it's a sketchy scene if  you're just walking by and you see that  go  down right the next morning I broke out  of the hospital I they let me use his  phone I called my buddies at the  University of I said hey swing through  the ER come break me out of here and I  broke out with in my gown with my butt  hanging out and I went back to the spot  where I landed in the blood on the  concrete and I tried to pound a beer and  my sinuses would just fill with blood  and then I'd go like Hawking up a lugie  and just spit the blood lugies into the  bowl of applesauce which I couldn't eat  the fact that you're here today steo  it's a miracle I know how the [ __ ] did I  survive  that so between Jackass the movies wild  boys I have a million questions about  bean bag shotguns and stapling your nuts  to stuff whatever you want man whatever  you want do you remember the first time  you ever got arrested doing a stunt I  guess the first time I got arrested  around a stunt was when I was charged  formally with a felony for obscenity in  Louisiana for stapling my nut sack to my  leg what do you think's the closest  you've ever been to dying on camera uh  I'm I'm so confident that it would be a  scuba diving I just like didn't pay  attention when I they taught me how to  scuba dive I don't even know what  country we were in but I was told the  Sharks were at the bottom something  about it went all the way to the bottom  and then someone was uh I felt some  grabb my fin and they're like and then  when we got up to the top the guy said  you [ __ ] you almost died and I  almost died trying to save you you  [ __ ] [ __ ] you can't you know like  there something about scuba diving that  I just don't understand and then what  was the most Savage off camera prank  that was ever puted oh man what a great  question that is there was the one that  was actually on camera but little known  about because it it lived on a on an  obscure DV that I put out by myself I um  filmed myself ejaculating onto the  computer keyboard and desk of the most  germaphobic producer of Jackass back in  the early days of the TV show and then I  wanted to go in there and film him just  typing away you know uh but my blabber  mouth I I had told too many people until  he found out about it and really  forensically cleaned everything so when  I went to film him I filmed him giving  me the most hilarious lecture ever you  know sooner enough as you're on your way  back to Florida when reality finally  said something man there's a lot of  stuff I could have been doing when I was  too busy jacking off on Scott's desk  yeah have a condiment Disorder so I'm  just I'm I'm going to just add the  Valentina when you jump off of a 35 ft  overpass from the bed of a moving truck  what happens beforehand is there physics  is there math are there sketches or is  it more just a grip it and rip it balls  to the wall whatever happens happens  mentality there was no practicing that  one because uh it was pretty illegal we  went up on foot and scouted the bridge  realizing that really you had to meet  that window you couldn't be it early or  late cuz you would hit uh pons you know  I mean it was important to get the  timing right normally in a situation  like that when it's a difficult thing a  dangerous thing one two three go is my  tool you know one two three go I count  that and I have never backed out of a  one two three go in my life oh  no all right so let's switch gears and  talk about standup For a wing cool man  do you remember the last time you had to  kick out a heckler I've had a pretty  good run of not having to do  that I [ __ ] hate having to do  that yeah  I thing about heckling is that it kind  of conjures up just the word heckling  conjures up the image of somebody witty  somebody challenging the comic like in a  way that's kind of confrontational and  then it's the onus on the comic to be  witty and shut them down with that one  just br brilliant sort of burn that that  shames them and and quiets them but  that's not the experience you know it's  just some drunk guy screaming 90% of the  time it's just drunk people and there's  just no making sense with them with that  said I can be pretty mean I don't like  it uh there happened times when when I  when  I totally lost my cool and said get the  [ __ ] out get him out you know and and  and particularly with like the the  videoing with the self it's so Insidious  in New Zealand I went off on it get her  out get her out and uh they wrote a  [ __ ] article about what a dick I was  in New Zealand and uh it's like dude you  know here I was worried about what like  there's like someone's going to post a  video of my show how many people are  going to see that on this person's  Facebook a handful but then when they  write the story about you everybody say  no Google search oh the latest news  about steo what a dick you know yelled  at a poor girl  [Music]  oh you have your own sauce how about  that I might do a little less dunking  now all right so we have a recurring  segment on our show called explain that  gram and what we do is we do a deep dive  on our guest Instagram we pull  interesting pictures that need more  context so I'll show you the picture and  then you just tell me the bigger story  does that sound good you got it all  right laptop please first and foremost  what's going on in this picture Okay  that was in St Louis 2 years ago at a  summer concert Festival I performed my  famous double back meaning I flopped my  dick and balls back and forth violently  until jumping up in the air and clasping  my thighs together catching the back  burger and then pull down my uh my boxer  shorts revealing the Manina to 15,000  people I had to pixelate the dick and  balls protruding from my rear for  Instagram strict guideline policy right  but Snapchat let that one slide  undercover clown with Justin  Bieber it wasn't actually planned and  when we were out in clown makeup filming  it in Venice just pranking people and  doing all this crazy [ __ ] and lo and  behold that's Justin Bieber just plain  plain day welome and uh I went up to him  and and I said yo dude what's up man and  he goes steo man recognize you right  away and I'm like wow like hey dude so  we started skateboarding in the Venice  skate park together he signed a releas  form to be in my video put it out and  then like maybe a week later he was uh  all over the news for uh making some  kind of racist joke in an age-old video  that had surfaced and there was all this  negative publicity and the Very people  who paid me asked me to make the video  private because Justin Bieber was like  radioactive so yeah so all of the money  they gave me was for nothing I have one  more for you this is an ad adorable  picture 9 years old uh the team was  called the Kendall  Broncos what's great about this isn't  that picture but that I was wearing that  same  uniform shoulder pads and everything  when I went into get my passport photo  taken for my Canadian citizenship card  this is so incredible because like  always as a child I was just  uncomfortable in my own skin which is  pretty part for the course for  alcoholics and stuff that's why you know  and like I just felt that in my football  uniform that I was more I I I amounted  to more I always had my outfit my my  costume that made me feel better I  wanted to grow my little mullet because  I was like a heavy meder you know and I  had to that was my identity and then and  then it was like skateboarding and then  it was pot and Drug but always like I  had to have that like identity you're in  a phase you in a you were always in a  phase perpetually in a phase I was never  just being me in my own skin well you  look like you're comfortable in your  skin I i' I've made a lot of progress in  that area and I appreciate you saying  [Music]  it so this one's dirty dicks it's an  aggressive brand name okay dirty dicks  how about  that I once recorded a rap  song called Down with STDs it's a good  name sounds like a good H dirty digs  from reminds me of  that I recorded it on a night when I was  smoking so much PCP that I actually  blacked out came to discovered that I  had destroyed the studio and the studio  was the studio of famed gangster rap  actually named Fame of mop you don't  [ __ ] with that guy you don't break his  [ __ ] no I was so [ __ ] up that night on  pgb recording down with us  that I lost a $20,000 Rolex man and for  all I know I [ __ ] made have money  giving it away what one sec allow me to  be unprofessional here for a sec do it  do  it oh KNX though should I answer hell  yeah you  should yeah dude yeah bro  dude hey man um I can't really talk  right now because I'm doing this uh  thing called hot ones where I eat like  outrageously hot [ __ ] while answering  salacious ill-advised  questions oh my good I'm getting harder  than Portland than Portland cement just  thinking about it right and so I just uh  figured I'd answer on speaker phone to  show up how I just got a call from the  captain okay well you you do your thing  sounds like you're busy and you're  finished eating the hot ones I'm I'm  available for hey for sure man I got I  can't wait to tell you funny stories  okay buddy luck all right thanks man all  right all right the captain the captain  the captain  man so as we've talked about already  we're eating vegan Wings you've been  very vocal about being an animal  Advocate over the last couple of years  so I want to talk about the time that  you scaled 100t crane 150 150t crane  over here on Sunset right you were  protesting SeaWorld right and I remember  it being pandemonium I remember the  emergency vehicles I remember it had  very much sort of like a standoff Not  only was it emergency vehicles now and  and just backtrack looking back on how  dumb could I have been right I mean I  went to go protest SeaWorld at a random  construction site nowhere near SeaWorld  I mean right out of the gate we're  talking stupid 150 ft up in the air  nobody can see your stupid [ __ ] toy  whale that high you know like pointless  now while I'm climbing up and enough  people called  911 that by the time I got the [ __ ]  whale inflated or shortly thereafter  there weren't just emergency responders  there were specifically as the police  report says 80 firefighters 18 cops a  helicopter and a SWAT team I had these  these artillery shells that you know you  light them in the tube and they shoot up  in the sky to make a big display but  what I did was I duct taped them to the  crane itself so they did not have the  opportunity to travel anywhere so that  when I lit them arms length away from my  body that the full blast designed to  make a display in the sky is an arms  length away from me you know and I'm  100t up in the air just to show that I'm  gnarly and I used my inflatable whale as  a  shield to protect me from the blast but  the problem was the blast occurred while  the police helicopter was circling  around me and it just added to a Litany  of [ __ ] criminal charges five in  total uh God they threw the goddamn book  at me and I deserved it you know I  remember reading the reports at the time  and you were facing something like 4 and  a half years or something crazy like  that I know you never end up  like it never happens but were you  worried probation jail time like any of  that I wasn't worried about at all what  it was was the restitution once you  start adding up 80 [ __ ] firefighters  18 cops and plus I was on the crane for  a good hour and a half I mean [ __ ]  helicopter cir you got to think  restitution to the city of California  everybody guessed like [ __ ] that's going  to be 200 Grand easy you know you got to  [ __ ] pay that back my dad was like  wow that was dumb but  Knoxville he he was like hey uh bud you  know um that's going to be an expensive  one hope you got a good lawyer and I  honestly don't know I do know why I  didn't just come down as soon as the  first cop showed up is because I had  promised  that uh I think I had promised that I  was going to light fireworks really high  in the air and I had to keep my word  yeah can't anybody down can't let  anybody  [Music]  down and you do this the same thing  every interview does it get easier so  there's nothing that surprises me you  know but I do feel it you know I'm human  let's really [ __ ] rock the boat on  this  love it try to keep it off the lips too  huh that's smart that's smart I [ __ ]  up over here okay yeah yeah all right  here we  [Music]  go Smokey let's talk about YouTube  because I think that in a lot of ways  jackass is sort of lowbudget  do-it-yourself extremeness really paved  away for a lot of what you see on  YouTube right now but I want to talk  about the stunts and the pranks  specifically because it's such a crowded  competitive and congested space on  YouTube right do you think that YouTube  is pushing that sort of art forward or  is it taking a step back do you ever  think about it I think what made jackass  successful is that the spirit of it was  very positive I mean granted yeah we  were destructive self harm very mean to  each other but we never targeted  innocent byst standards  right we never uh were mean-spirited to  anybody outside of us and that is what's  lost on a lot of YouTube pranksters you  know you see a lot of mean-spirited  pranks going on and it goes by and it's  wildly popular and successful and It's  upsetting for me to see that at the same  time YouTube really exploded between the  second Jackass movie and the third  and by the time the third Jackass movie  came  around we were scouring YouTube for  ideas right yeah so I mean again it's um  it's a step forward step backwards  there's so much going on that you can't  just make one uh Claim about what  YouTube is good or bad  for my throat my [ __ ] body's telling  me that I'm just Gravely [ __ ] up but  I'm going to just do this because that's  who I am cuz you're a showman Ste cuz  you're a  [Music]  showman getting through them Mega Death  sauce I like that it's a good name so  growing up I know that you idolized rock  stars specifically of the 8S hair metal  era so what I've done is I've pulled up  some icons from the genre I just want to  show them to you and then just get your  snap reaction to them does that sound  good right I love it my man Tommy Lee  T-Bone bless his heart I mean I could go  through I go through the whole story  about how I met Molly Crew when I was a  little kid there were uh in my town I  was 13 I called every hotel in the  Yellow Pages asking for a room by the  name of their manager  got through and was lucky enough that  the brother of the manager answered and  was impressed by my initiative and put  me on the list for backstage passes so  there wasn't that much crazy that  happened backstage that night and I  certainly didn't have anything um  pressing to ask or discuss with them but  by the virtue of the fact that I was  standing next to these guys through my  own sheer perseverance and initiative it  just empowered me man I was like [ __ ] I  made this happen here I am with Molly  [ __ ] Cru and I think that I took that  attitude largely through the rest of my  life you know with me like I I can  [ __ ] do anything were you a Sebastian  Bach guy of course he's notorious for uh  getting roped into a terrible contract  by John bonji I think John John bonjovi  should be for more [ __ ] accountable  for being a [ __ ] dickwad [ __ ]  screwing people over business wise you  hear about his relationship with Richie  Sora but I understand that John bonjovi  really [ __ ] over Sebastian Bach and he  just skates around like it didn't happen  [ __ ] Don Bon  jooby isn't it already on there so it's  funny that you say that it's tradition  around here to put a little dab on the  last Wing this is another hot one sauce  it's called the last dab you don't have  to you don't have to if you don't want  more than a little dab you don't have to  if you don't want to you don't have to  to I'm not going to do a dab I'm going  to compromise with a shmear a  we've had people we've had people shmear  we've had people shmear the shmear is a  relatively popular right workaround and  I think it's fair right you don't know  what's coming out of that bottle you'd  rather control that a little bit right  steo I would say this on a reaction  level you're very chill I know that you  came in here with my dad taught me one  motto in life always under promise and  overd  deliver all right  you know here we are at the end of our  episode mhm got I feel sorry for the  poor guy who had to edit it so much  gold steo as we've discussed today  you're a man who has long had Hollywood  dreams and through swimming with sharks  and jumping off of buildings and putting  hooks through your face you've been able  to realize those dreams  you really are a living example of how  you can do anything you want in this  world and that's coming from a guy who  eats chicken wings on YouTube holy [ __ ]  I'm like where the [ __ ] is the  teleprompter this guy is good I'm  like I'm reading that's all I'm your  shirt D you're impressive Talent I'm  impressed by you okay thanks Ste I like  this as my new motto in life it doesn't  really matter what you want it just  matters how badly you want it well yeah  what if you want to be an NBA player  it's never going to happen you know of  course there's limitation  but whatever you want to [ __ ] do get  off your ass and start [ __ ] doing it  and then when the ship's there if you're  ready for it you'll be on it and you're  going to sail and that's all the that's  all you need to know and you know what  else the people need to know what that  you made it through that you cleared the  board that you came in and dominated the  vegan chicken wings and now there's just  one thing left to do this camera this  camera or this camera let the people  know what you have going on in your life  and I'm I'm living my life in a way  where I can look myself in the mirror  and and believe like I'm a good person  and uh and I have a relationship with  the universe a lot of people like to  call it God you know and by the virtue  of that fact I can look in the mirror  and see great hair wrinkles and I'm cool  with it man you know I'm cool with it  dude I'm in a good  place hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today I'm joined by post Malone what's  going on brother he's fresh off the  purpose tour Justin Bieber his debut  album Stony is set to drop on December  9th host welcome to the show well thank  you for having me brother how are you  with hot food I mean I like it I don't  know how I feel about about this whole  setup over here like the with the Mega  Death sauce I mean I really feel it in  my stomach I feel like it's just going  to be a hell of a trip and a hell of a  trip to the toilet later I'm ready to  get  [Music]  weird BM the swings for post Malone come  only the best I'm I'm very lazy I have  very dainty fingers delicate fingers so  I can't really you know get into that  type of  [Music]  stuff I never try Sriracha do you like  it yeah it's zingy so you credit Guitar  Hero for inspiring you to learn guitar  and in a way kind of Paving the way for  your music career I feel  like there's a lot of people that are  like you know why play Guitar Hero when  you could play real guitar right and you  know Prince said that too as long as you  develop a love for music any way that  you develop it and you take it to you  know the real world I feel like it's you  know I feel like it's the same are there  any other games that kind of mirror your  life any other ones that are super  important to you  Skyrim you don't need friends with that  video game you can just get lost and  live your life you could you're the  dragon born bro you can do whatever you  want it's  whatever that's a great flavor you burst  on the scene in such a fast and extreme  way and when that happens I sometimes  wonder if these sort of on the come up  coming of age moments ever match up to  the dreams or the fantasies that you  have for them so I want to give you some  and then you can to tell me if it lived  up to the hype or if it was a little  disappointing okay okay cool let's do it  what about your first red carpet do you  remember that I remember my first red  carpet it was super um awkward whenever  people hype me up or whatever I feel  like I I don't meet the expectations so  I'm just like I don't know what what you  wanted me to do I don't know it's like  Ricky Bobby yeah he like what do I do  with my hands how about your first time  flying private that was worth it I think  my first time fing private I was going  to Vegas with Scott and we got the smoke  on there and that was like a dream come  true so how about the first famous  person to come up to you as sort of like  in a fan way I think I think my first  experience really came through social  media like with Whiz Khalifa and M  Miller when they started TW out the  sound L and that was super dope but I  think my first time on the street was on  Fairfax I was just walking down and  someone came took a picture and it's a  crazy feeling that's when you're like oh  [ __ ] it's not really happening  [Music]  pante the chili Habano there you  go how was that one pretty good yeah it  was good you have the unique distinction  of having worked with Kanye West and  Justin Bieber who are a couple guys you  know their personal lives they seem so  impenetrable but people are so  fascinated by them and I know that  you're way too much of a gentleman to  give me any sort of details and I  respect that but I do Wonder just seeing  the way those guys move this seeing the  way they work the stage seeing how they  are in the Studio do you see any  similarities between the two they're so  driven like they're so driven to like a  completed task they start something  they're going to finish it every time I  don't know how he does a show every  night for 2 hours for almost a year  every night like he's a super human how  about two for you you know going from  kind of playing small stages at South by  Southwest to all of a sudden being on  the purpose tour was there some sort of  like Superstar crash course that you had  to go through or did they just sort of  send you out there in front of all those  people and are like perform your set  that's the craziest thing ever walking  out to a stadium audience right you  don't know if they're going to like you  the first time I came out there  everybody was singing the song and  everybody knew the words to the song I  was so nervous and it never got better  the whole time really every time you  took the stage same feeling no it's the  same feeling it's terrifying because  you're in like weird places like  Saskatoon right and like broken tree  Iowa I don't know if that's a place but  but it sounds like it yeah no it sounds  good I feel like I need to see your  bites and see what kind of bites you're  taking so you can gauge mhm  or are you like one of our commenters  and you think there's like some sort of  conspiracy and I'm not even actually  taking  bites I know I'm a conspiracy guy but  yeah you are yeah so this next part of  the show is called explain that gram and  you've seen the show before so you know  how it works we've done a deep dive on  your Instagram we've pulled some pics  that we think need more context we'll  just show you the picture and you tell  me the bigger story okay mhm laptop  please hell yeah that's a strong man all  right so this one's interesting you and  usin both yeah we were in London and we  went to this place called Circ I think  he was

cloud with rain coming down it  wasn't a lady it was a boy but it looked  like a lady what  about this is hell yeah you and Toby  Keith you know what it was one of the  dopest nights of my life it was

that's  what you're going for I think it really  speaks for  itself um it's got a great texture  you're a guy who started getting tatted  when you really started making money and  drawing eyeballs and

impossible to do a  post balone interview without talking  about clothes whether it's gold teeth  it's cowboy boots it's high fashioned  you definitely have a look that's all  your own and I think your fans might be  surprised or at least some of them that  this is not a new development is it true  your stepmom she used to have to press  your suits when you'd go to Junior High  you'd wear suits in junior high I had to  have it I had to have everything on  fleek that's a very interesting thing  for someone who's Middle School to do to  come to school every day in a suit well  I wanted to be my dad so I would slick  my hair back I had short hair  um and I just you know tucked in my  shirt I had everything perfectly pleated  and perfectly starched um I was super  fly but how do the kids in junior high  treat the kid who wears a suit to school  every day is that a cool thing to do or  do they tease you do they make fun of  you that's a great question you know  I've had my fair share of  kids used to throw gum in my hair they  used to throw gum in your hair look at  me now  [ __ ] I'm eating hot very hot  wings but you know  um it was tough I had my own I was an  individual and people don't like that  right people don't like when you're  different from them and you go against  the norm this Wing is hot but I respect  you because you did it every day anyway  yeah [ __ ] it and I still do [ __ ] I still  do [ __ ] only you can appreciate the  genius that is you and everybody has a  genius in themselves because at the end  of the day you're not going to die with  the feelings of these people you're  going to die at yourself right so you  just have to love who you are and do  what you want to do whatever makes you  happy rock  [Music]  on  Swag yeah it's time for this

today I'm joined by Keegan Mich key  Jordan Peele together their Key and  Peele and they star in Keanu in theaters  April 29th a film that explores the age  old question how far is a man willing to  go to save his adorable kitty cat it's a  question that's been asked for Millennia  very funny I saw it last night the first  spit take of my adult life actually I  had a you film the first one the first  spit take of my adult life what moment  what moment you don't want to misquote  but I was taking a very usual suspect I  was taking a very deep sip of sprite  when I heard wordness to the turdness oh  my God and unbelievable right back into  C into the cup this is a text I sent uh  Keegan a couple of years ago and then we  had to put I can't remember I wish I  could remember what the context of it  was wordness to the tness all right you  guys ready  [Music]  ready so we have double the talent half  as many wings this time around  first wing hot ones fire each Chipotle  it's actually our sauce this is your  sauce made by homeboy distributed by  heatness you can find it online already  mouth is watering that's good thank you  one of the things that kind of stands  out to me in the movie is Method Man's  performance and that guy has a ton of  roles over the years and many of them  are comedic roles which kind of flies in  the face of what I think a lot of people  think of when they think of Method Man  he's very um he's very much real guy he  has the same problems that any of us  have  he just sounds a lot cooler when he  talks about them he literally was pacing  onset one day completely frustrated yeah  because the principal had two kids are  the same age which really commonly known  as twins um they have the graduation and  he was getting very upset cuz he was  going this ridiculous man superintendent  I'm going tell me I'm going to get three  tickets I should get six [ __ ] tickets  this is ridiculous man I got two  children how my aunt supposed to see my  my babies me they help raise my kids so  they on the mathematics and everything  that's some stupid [ __ ] I got to make a  phone call I mean it's like mundane  school stuff stuff he he never wrapped  about this guy never wrapped about this  Jazz and it's kind of funny to see a guy  like Method Man have just everyday  normal people problems oh my God right  yeah he has to wake up one shoe at a  time like the rest of us is that he Wes  yeah he wakes up one shoe at a time  that's the saying people say that every  day someone said that this morning this  guy back here said it I guarantee  it all right ready for number two hot  ones that's a nice sauce this is where  it we're going up a little bit we're  going up 100% yep [ __ ] Keegan my guess  is that you've been asked about Luther  Obama's pain Obama's anger translator  also Obama's pain translator emotional  pain yes yes emotional pain anger  translator and you've probably been  asked about it in every interview since  that White House correspondent's dinner  hold on to your Lily white  butts what's your most treasured memory  from that night the mo the most  treasured for me this is not a joke a  joke I'm about to also not tell a joke  100%  100% how's the pain what 100% mm no no  ain't no a no  99% but here's the thing you start you  got this is the second one only two no  we still got three to go we were talk we

experience but having the ability to  touch him and he was perfectly cool at  that when we rehearsed it which was that  was awesome being able to touch him and  also I guess the best one would have  been with Michelle Michelle you right  brother you  okay were you a little nervous about  touching him for the first time do you  think like security like Secret Service  would CH you out oh my god well he runs  into the room and runs up to me and he  broke hugs me and I'm like it's not me  I'm not doing it I'm not doing it take  please you can feel like a red dot on  your forehead like he grab

that nobody  want see did he say the water sketch  water sketch water sketch there's a milk  sketch in that uh oh milk sketch milk  sketch is the one for  me milk sketch is the one for me all  right you guys ready to do this last one  last one what you know what Sean so yeah  you go to  hell I want you to look at the  consistency of this now so this is touch  it with your bare hands it's kind of  tradition around give me just a second  take a walk take a lap to dab the last  one dab it we dab the last one dab your  own ass off man dab your own ass and  then you guys you know what if you don't  want who [ __ ] idea was this show you  don't want to you don't have to that's a  big dab are do you have like a  unrealistic chob he's got one of those  things your whole inside is made out of  like some kind of  synthetic like I'm like it's not fair  like ins yeah the inside of your body is  made out of his best it's like remember  in The Princess Bride when the guy had  like built up the immunity to the  [ __ ] poison that's where I'm at  that's you you're the dreaded pirate  Roberts right now what what happens and  this whole thing is inconceivable are  you at all impressed with this or is it  just it just seems like a a type of  Madness like maybe I should go get  something checked out it seems like you  figured out something you can do and you  built a whole show around it that's what  it seems like is that what we did oh  yeah  more power to you oh you go to hell Sean  all right so for this last Wing if you  don't want to dab you don't have to dab  some people dab why are you going to  bring up dabbing man I'm going to I'm  going to dab you got you got to dab you  got to you're not going to dab don't  dab you're not going to dab so and then  this last question I'm going to bring It  full circle I'm going from the Second  City main stage from ke and Peele this  guy's got the Deep Cuts all the way to  Keanu okay okay so there's a little dab  my favorite character is ever were the  valet but did you see that Liam nces  movie with them wolves though the one  with them big ass wolves and Liam nces  Liam n is my [ __ ] and they probably  would have been so hyped to see Keanu so  for this last one let's all take a bite  and we'll all die you got a dab and then  I want to sort of reimagine no don't D  that much how the how the valet would  talk about Keanu after seeing it so that  sound like a good plan oh you dabbed out  all right cheers I'm trying to spread  this dab out dab it out that's a sick  dab dab step  so I don't like the way he did  it I don't like the way he did it all  fast he was scared he was scared he was  scared yo you see that he's sweating you  see that ke and peels  movie that movie was that movie that  movie was fire I don't

m o man yep yep  yep yep yep they got the Willie forts in  there I'm  speechless cuz I don't got no vocal  cords left you remember that part at the  end of the sketch where we blow up yeah  let's do that right  now yeah you made it all the way through  hot ones it's so high stakes I know we  put you guys through a lot but at the  end 30 second plug how amazing is that  30 seconds we have to stay alive for 30  seconds floor is yours tell the people  what they should see well if you're  watching this  show don't ever come on the show don't  come on it don't make don't get into the  film industry cuz you might end up on  this show here do go seek panu on April  29th don't order the  wings just keep your feet planted on the  ground godam and keep reaching for the  Stars  hey what's going on everybody for first  we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and  today we close out Season 16 with Tom  Holland he began his career at 12 years  old in the West End production of Billy  Elliott now he's one of Hollywood's  biggest box office draws from  award-winning performances in the  impossible to the Marvel Cinematic  Universe and on the topic of the latter  he stars in what sure to be one of the  year's biggest films Spider-Man no way  home which is set to release in theaters  on December 17th Tom Holland welcome to  to the show hello mate thank you thank  you for having me and before we begin  one last time for season 16 how are you  a spicy food what's going through your  head as we prepare to dig in I'm okay  with spicy food I mean at nandos I'm a  medium or a hot if I'm feeling  adventurous extra hot is too far gone  for me so I think today is going to be  rather brutal and I think everyone will  get to see a side to me that no one has  ever seen before maybe I haven't even  seen this side to me that's about to  come out but I'm very excited I'm a huge  fan of the show it was actually my mate  Twain a couple years ago was like you  should do this show called Hot ones I  was like what's hot ones he's like it's  this show where you eat spicy chicken  wings and you talk about stuff I was  like that sounds so stupid and then I  watched the first episode I watched  Idris Ela immediately was obsessed with  your show and have since then been a  huge fan  [Music]  the classic Hot Sauce  [Music]  okay oh yeah other side other side other  side you just saved me if I went for the  worst one the first Wing D can you  imagine can I say a huge thank you  because that would have been we would  have cut this well short okay so we're  going over here yep all right  oh yeah that's  [Music]  nice wow I am getting a bit of a kick  now though mhm so Spider-Man no way home  features the return of Alfred Molina as  Dr Octopus a role that he had more than  15 years ago which I imagine is a unique  situation for an actor can you recall an  instance of his mind being blown by the  technology and Innovation that goes into  making Spider-Man movies today I got a  delayed reaction the old classic C  Source there um obviously when he was  making the film I think it was 2002  maybe mhm his arms his sort of robotic  arms were puppets they were like real  tangible things and they'd have a guy on  each one and they would Puppeteer them  while he was performing so he had to  work in tandem with the other four guys  on this film obviously technology has  advanced CGI has become so you know  prevalent in these films so it was  amazing seeing him have a bit more  freedom on set with the way he could  move without having to rely on other  people we had this thing called a  toothpick rig which is like a Long Bar  like almost like a crane with a platform  on one end and weights on the other and  they put him on that crane so they can  move him around so that it looks like  the arms are carrying him and he loved  it like he absolutely loved it but the  funny thing is is that you'd be talking  to him and he'd be attached to the rig  and because he has no control over where  he goes he'd be talking to you he be  like yeah so Tom I'm from South London  and then he would just suddenly like  disappear and he be like oh [ __ ] hell  mate I'll see you later so it was a it  was a p a a pavage sorry the spices know  is I've got still chicken in my teeth  right oh and it comes I know that I know  that all too well there's lots of times  I'm putting up a front like it's not  bothering me but I every episode every  episode I have but it um it was a it was  a privilege to get to work with um with  Alfred he was a good guy I really liked  working with him  [Music]  it's very sweet mhm that was really nice  I actually really like that one it was  quite sweet I didn't really get any  vinegar but it was nice I liked it the  next one looks nasty though it's very  red chicken's not supposed to be red  like that okay so I was interested to  read that Spider-Man no way home  director John Watts actually assigned a  John Hughes movie marathon which you  hosted at your Atlanta home yes and I'm  curious if you think there's any common  DNA between the Spider-Man franchise  that you star in and then these classic  Coming of Age teen movies from the 1980s  there definitely is John definitely took  uh inspiration from those movies there  are aspects of the way characters are  dressed or the way they look that is  definitely um inspired by by those  movies um and I think that is what sets  our franchise apart from the rest of the  kind of superhero genre is that they  have this kind of really happy go-lucky  teenage Coming of Age high school movie  Vibe which I've never really seen before  in a superhero film Ferris bu's day off  for me was the one that had the most  inspiration for Spider-Man this kid  who's kind of breaking the rules but he  kind of is doing it for the right  reasons but the biggest inspiration for  me and my biggest goal in playing  Spider-Man was I really wanted to be  this generation's Martin McFly yeah I  love that that's up for everyone else's  opinion but for me I'm really proud of  what we did and especially my  relationship between me and Downey to me  there's a lot of similarities between  Marty and Doc and I know that they have  deep faked us and made that happen which  actually was a huge honor for me I loved  seeing it uh but um but yeah so that for  me would have been the biggest  [Music]  inspiration I'm feeling good I'm feeling  good you look good thank you  mate yeah that's  nice kind of like a barbecue sauce with  like a little kick to  it yeah that feels that's good I like  that one so your career it's taking you  around the world and I've read that you  like to visit golf courses in each new  city that you visit I played baseball my  whole life and I think the muscle memory  of swinging a bat has ruined any  potential I'll ever have of being good  at golf do you have any general swing  tips for just hopeless duffers like  [Music]  myself all I mean  we shorten your back swing is what I'd  say cuz the golf clubs now the  technology is so Advanced that you don't  have to hit it that hard for the ball to  go that far a distance so shorten your  back swing and don't try and hit it too  hard well I'm taking notes they're down  I'll apply them to the course next time  I go are you ready to move on here to  the next Wing Los centes Verde and  you're doing great Los centes Verde okay  this one looks like it's going to  surprise me it's got a bit of a green  Hue in there it is it's got a green hue  oh it's immediately spicy this one  [ __ ] I'm going to go for a second hit  though but you're going back  in cuz it's really  nice salute oh [ __ ] okay wow wow this is  such a good idea for an interview  because my  brain my brain is all over the place you  could ask me anything and I would be so  honest  so you had an interesting line on the  Nerdist podcast where you talked about  how playing a superhero kind of takes  away your biggest superpower as an actor  since you're also covering your face  right what do you see as the limitations  or maybe even the opportunities for an  actor when you do spend half a movie in  behind a costume I mean it comes with  its own set of challenges for sure [ __ ]  me  wow I want to try and do this and not  have any milk okay we'll see how that  goes I don't think that's GNA yeah  there's no sh we're not even we're only  four  in it's definitely difficult I mean as  an actor you use expression with your  face to convey emotion and when you take  that away you have to figure out how to  do it with your physicality so if you  took off the Spider-Man suit and I  behaved the way I would while in the  suit you'd think I was a crazy person  and acting way way too much and too big  but cover up your face all of a sudden  those bigger reactions feel normal my  secret weapon is that I will always  pretend like my arms are dead so that  when I move my arms kind of swing around  so it's Peter Parker's hands are always  doing the most crazy stuff and for me  that has been a really good way of like  making him feel youthful while also in  moments of peril and and stuff like that  um but it's also sometimes a great thing  like if I've gone out the night before  and had a little bit too much to drink  if I've got a mask on no one knows so  it's fine  [Music]  I'm supposed to be going to a Lakers  game tonight I'm going to have to go and  [ __ ] after every  quarter let's do this  revolutionary this one's a  little  yeah one's good that is revolutionary  yeah [ __ ] H as advertised  wow wow all right Tom we have curring  segment on our show called explain that  gram where we do a deep dive on our  guest Instagram pull interesting  pictures that need more context so we'll  show you the picture over here on the  monitor Johny b a fellow season 16 hot  ons Alum right there right I love him so  much he's one of the greatest guys I've  ever met I remember doing a scene with  him I told the story yesterday actually  and I said to him sometimes as an actor  if you're doing a scene that requires  like real stress I find it quite helpful  if someone kind of roughs me up a little  bit and I said to I was like make listen  before the scene could you just rough me  up a bit and and uh you know just just  scare me a little bit please and he was  like n man I don't want to do that like  you're my little brother I love you man  I don't want to do that okay I I  appreciate that if you don't want to do  that that's fine and they went right my  rolling and they went action and he  went and I was like oh my God and it was  great and it worked so well for the  scene but he just he just didn't want me  to know it was coming but he properly  cracked me one I looked back on that as  a very fond experience and meeting him  was you know one of the highlights we  haven't had the chance to work together  since but I would love to oh my  God it just came back yeah they can they  can sometimes when you least expect it  but like from deep  within  go this looks really nice I can't wait  to try it okay I'm just going to eat it  ready  ready oh no  oh  no oh that's not that bad at first at  first oh it comes oh yeah yeah starts to  grow on you a little bit so interesting  is it how it hits you like  wow that's  [Music]  amazing sometimes I really try to figure  out how to make my voice  sound cooler if I'm doing scenes I just  need to eat [ __ ] spicy we figured out  a technique here  today  wow  okay I'm going to go for a second hit  because I want to okay then I'm going  back into see how that  okay I feel like I'm really seeing the  actor's side of you you know like really  immersing yourself in the experience I  really want to see what this is about  West way worse second time  wow well  it's in my nose  [Music]  now so I know that while you're weary of  overly Ladish behavior that the pub  culture the old school Pub culture it  still has a special place in your heart  and then pub food to me it's an endless  topic of Fascination whenever we visit  London can you explain what a carv is  for the uninitiated oh a carv right a  carv  is firstly amazing it is a portion of  food that normally revolves around a  piece of meat it can be any  meat I don't know if this is an actual  rule but I know that my local pub used  to do it when we were kids but if you're  16 so 2 years under the legal drinking  age if you have a carv they are allowed  to serve you a pint of beer I guess the  idea is is that the amount of food  cancels out the beer obviously as kids  we would abuse that rule and go and not  eat the food and just drink a beer but a  carv is like a portion of meat with food  like a roast dinner what does it mean if  a dish is mingy minging means it's  disgusting like that last Wing was  minging well if you thought that was  minging we'll see what you think about  the next one the milk looks so  good  wow oh yeah that's that's not that bad  wow that one's not bad I like that one  yeah it's  tasty it's the second hit it's yeah I  think it's when you go back in it's not  didn't coming into play I here to eat  these chicken  wings so there's a lot of lore  surrounding that 10-minute long tsunami  scene that opens up the impossible your  feature film debut yeah is it true that  you guys only had one shot of doing that  because to rebuild the set and shoot it  again would have blown the budget  yes oh my  gosh essentially what they did is they  built they built um like a oh man my  lips are  [Music]  oh they built a set that was a third of  the size of the actual hotel in which it  happened the the they had something like  3 million lers of water in a huge tank  with these Breakaway doors and  essentially the director had this big  red button I think they were using  something like 14 cameras at the same  time all set in specific locations there  was obviously no one on set while this  was happening because it was very  dangerous  oh my God then they hit the button and  the water came out and destroyed the set  and it was incredibly impressive to  witness it looks great in the film and  then obviously what they do is they  upscale it so the third size model then  looks full size and then they put us in  they Comp US in and it was amazing it  was really  incredible and um and that's that's the  end of my story and [ __ ] me that is so  spicy is it true that you blew a Star  Wars audition cuz you couldn't contain  your laughter reading lines opposite  someone pretending to be a Droid yeah  yeah this that's very true I don't think  that's the reason why I didn't get the  role I think John Boer was just better  for the role than me um but I just  remember thinking there's no way this  lady is going to read the robots lines  opposite me just because that would be  ridiculous and I don't remember what my  line was but it was let's get back to  the Falcon and then this lady blesser  would sit there with full commitment and  she just was  like and I just remember thinking the  first time she did it I went Ah that's  funny oh wow all right brilliant we'll  do it again we'll do it again sorry did  the line  again I remember sort of saying like  you're not actually going to do that  right and she was like well yeah the  robots part of the scene is the  character it's R2D2 or c3p I don't know  yeah I just got the giggles because you  know when you realize you've got  something so wrong yeah I just couldn't  stop  laughing I'm not going to try the lemon  cuz I want to I want to do the whole  experience I want to and then at the end  when we cut the cameras I'm going to  drink that milk so quickly CRA we're  going to bring in a whole other G I'm  going to Dr it so quickly you have no  [Music]  idea let's do it the the bomb all right  ready y let's do  it oh I've gone for the bone oh wow

going we  ready oh yeah that's spicy man oh  wow oh yeah wow okay so I'm always  amused when I hear you say that people  confuse you from one of those British  actors with classic training remarking  that you went only to 2% of drama school  classes what do you think an actor  learns just going directly into the  industry talking to directors being on  set that maybe they wouldn't pick up if  they went to a prestigious drama school  like  R um I think that  sometimes uh a benefit of not going to  drama school is going in fresh and  allowing your teachers to  be the director you know and this is a  piece of advice I got from Rober Downey  actually to let my body do the work  rather than thinking about everything so  for me I tend to learn my lines the  morning of so that the moment I'm saying  them they're as fresh as  possible and uh is that doctor here cuz  [ __ ]  wow I'm not joking no I'm  joking he's a good actor he's a good  actor this might be the best milk right  it's I've ever had like an oasis like  You' been walking through the  desert that's exactly what it feels like  right the last one on the list  [Music]  Apollo the last dab with the Apollo  [Music]  pepper okay all right let's do this last  dab but I have to say you know whoa  that's too much is  it listen I've committed  now cuz there looks very that looks like  maybe maybe hit that with a little no  I've done it I've made my bed I'm going  to lay in  it okay  okay I feel like I'm about to jump off a  cliff or  something that's a lot as well I put way  you put a tiny bit on there you're  showing your experience I know but you  know what I got to join the party this  is the season 16 wow yours wow this is  the season 16 Finale wow the season  finale and Tom you've been so brave  coming into this not sure how it was  going to go and look at you drenching  sauces going in for double  hit all right let's do this it's been a  pleasure mate I've really enjoyed this  pleasure is all  mine oh look how much I  [Music]  got I hate my  [Laughter]  job oh mate I know but to  the good thing is you've slayed the  spicy sauce Beast we have put the nail  in the coffin of season 16 and if we've  learned anything through this interview  it's that you love movies and that you  love making movies and I've heard that  you have a propensity to maybe take a  souvenir or two from set and so to close  things out I just want to ask you of all  of those souvenirs that you've taken  from movie sets over the years what is  your Holy Grail the one that has the  most sentimental value to you the most  oh wow I'm going in  [Music]  wao next time I do a crying scene I'm  calling you and you got to send me this  hot sauce I will show up and set I will  show up and  set my favorite souvenir was actually  given to me  it wasn't given to me it was given to my  little brother  Patty when Black Panther was coming out  Robert Downey Jr was making Dr do little  in  London and he was staying down the road  from where I  live and he invited us to a screening of  black  panther at his house and Patty comes  running into the room and he's holding  the original Iron Man helmet and Downey  had given it to him as a gift  that's a really special one for me  because I was lucky enough to join the  MCU but I joined it very  late and that souvenir you know that's  from the original film that's the the  birthplace of this incredible world that  Kevin feige and Marvel have created you  know and Downey and favro kickstarted so  to have something from that film is a  huge  honor a holy grail and look at you Tom  Holland putting a bow on season 16  taking on the wings of death and living  to tell the tale and now there's nothing  left to do but roll out the red carpet  for you Tom Holland this camera this  camera this camera let the people know  what you have going on in your life  Spider-Man no way home is coming out  December  17th it's the best Spider-Man movie  that's ever been made it's so fun and  exciting it's emotional it's  heartfelt I've been so it's such an  honor for me to play Spider Man full  this time and for it to come to this  point honestly he means his well to  me I'm going to be  sick hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings today  I'm joined by Kevin Hart damn right you  are he needs no introduction the new  film what now comes out October 14th yes  and this ain't no Netflix special you  guys had a budget yeah this is uh this  is the real deal Sean you know we uh we  went all the way I filmed it at a  football stadium which has never been  done it's a dope thing do made history  53,000 people and I actually put a a  mini action movie in front of the comedy  special that gets me to the special so  it's different and before we begin you  tell this great story about how early on  in your career you were bombing on stage  and someone pelted you with a half eaten  chicken 100% true I think you called it  the worst memory ever little sauce was  on it too some of that sauce got in my  eye he hit me with a buffalo wing my  joke frustrated him to the point where  he felt the need to stand up and throw  food at me which is never good you know  it's never good I said who threw it you  know you expected to be quiet so you can  say some stuff to just look like you're  about to defend yourself and he was like  I did and I said well [ __ ] uh good throw  and I just good night I just got off the  stage so chicken wings one Kevin Hart  zero are you ready to even the score I'm  [Music]  ready so this first one is sriracha the  first is sh be easy though  right so what now is unlike any comedy  feature I've ever seen in my life with  the soldout Philadelphia Eagle Stadium  looking like a damn Beyonce concert damn  right it does you've said that you train  like an athlete but you seem to be  motivated like one two you want to hang  a banner you want to put on the ring for  me it's it's about history it's about  making sure that that last name heart  means something when it's all said and  done you know my kids um I want them to  understand not only who their father is  but why he's in a position that he's in  doing this particular  movie this is putting me in position to  to become closer to the ultimate goal  and and that ultimate goal is just  history man it's history history  history so this one's tapao tapao take a  bite of that that ain't nothing mhm top  ofo ain't nothing baby bring on the hot  [ __ ] thinking back on your jobs that you  had before you were famous do you have  fonder memories as a shoe salesman or  that summer that you were a lifeguard  summer I was a lifeguard for two reasons  first of all being a shoe salesman was  amazing but being a lifeguard that's  where some of the funniest stuff has  ever happened you know uh a little boy  almost drowned on my watch cuz I thought  he was playing and um you know the other  lifeguard from acros jumped in to save  him and he was like heart what happened  I was like I thought he was playing that  was not a good excuse in your life my  thing is kids play too much that's fair  been playing like you were drowning just  to get me in the water to go ha I wasn't  drowning it just so happened at that  time he was drowning lesson  learn this is El yukco Caribbean  habanero who taught you the enunciation  of this stuff goodness man what would  you call this uh I would call it the E  bottle that that they start with a e  what did you say is Yuka what yukco  Caribbean havo all right we going to  drink the TECO see that see I just  nicknamed it we're going to drink some  of this Teo baby so everyone knows mhm  this is TECO we getting hot Ain we oo  going up going up going up we out here  now so everyone knows the Kevin Hart in  2016 starring in Blockbusters dominating  social media but I don't think a lot of  people know how long and hard that road  is you know getting paid in french fries  sleeping in your car and one of the  strangest tidbits that stands out to me  used to do gigs at a place called sweet  cheeks sweet cheeks where you warmed up  the crowd for exotic male  dancers first of all I don't want nobody  judging me okay you know my friends are  looking at me different cuz they don't  know the whole story brother this was at  a different time in my life sweet cheeks  was a male strip club and uh I wasn't  dancing right doing audience work yeah  you know I would basically okay let me  explain it so the strippers they would  be stripping right and they would stop  the strippers they like all right fellas  go in the back you know they got to go  in the back and change right so then  they would go why they changing got to  get show going we got some comedy and uh  it wasn't really a good segue it doesn't  seem like it would be it would it would  go from the the male strippers and they  would go introducing Lil C the bastard  that was my name at the time and I was  on stage one time and this lady was like  pull your dick out and I like wait a  minute now I ain't even about that I'm  up here slanging these jokes I'm here  for the joke life you know uh but they  didn't want to hear  that the name of it is pain is good I  don't understand it's not pain is bad  well what's the marketing behind that I  don't understand that okay let's go  ahead then mhm well we out here  now oh yeah oh [ __ ] so speaking of early  on in your career one of the first IMDb  credits you have is this film called  Paper Soldiers which is a very unique  project because it was this Dame Dash  Jay-Z Rockefeller production you star  alongside beanie seagull and Memphis  blee when you look back on that project  and that time in your career what do you  take away that was a good time man you  know that's the beginning shouts out to  Dame Dash  um Dame Dash saw me perform at  Caroline's comedy club he wanted to talk  to me after told me he had a funny idea  we meet we discuss it uh he said I want  you to star in it he said I got some  other comedians the other Comedians and  I got together Charlie Murphy helped  write and navigate the story to where it  can become a real funny comedy and beans  came in and we developed something that  was dope like it wasn't supposed to be  what it was and it ended up surpassing  what we thought it was going to do and  it act as a vehicle for me you know  Paper Soldiers is one of the reasons why  I was able to get a tape and get  management you know go out and get an  agent you know just get people to see  that there was a talent behind the  comedian so it acted as a real for me at  one point which was  good this next hot sauce is the hot one  hot sauce the what you're on the hot one  show so you're not the only one  enterprising here no this is y'all you  this is the  okay this is your concoction Yep this is  our concoction okay now how would you  it's in the middle so it's not crazy  like the stuff coming up but it's like a  it's funny that you say that because  it's a transition sauce so it's a little  bit sweeter it's not going to you know  it ain't going to set my ass on fire  it's not going to set your ass on fire  okay all right  mhm I think I still taste a couple of  the other ones too cuz every time I take  another  bite comes back yeah the fire come back  like I'll put it out for a second and  then that should come back like right  now I don't want to drink the milk but I  might have to soon so this next thing is  called explain that gram and what we've  done is we've done a deep dive on your  Instagram and pulled a couple  interesting pictures that we just need  more context we need more than the  caption we need the bigger picture I  just want to show them to you and then  you let me know what's going on okay  Kevin Hart and his best man oh man  that's me and my guy it's me and my  handsome son man my best man reason why  my son was my best man is because he's  my best friend and I felt that my son  should be there for his dad on uh his  big day and before the wedding he  actually gave a toast in the back he  gave a little quick toast we gave him  some juice in his cup and we all had a  shot he held it up man it was cool all  right so this one Squad goals AF in  South Africa yeah yeah what is going on  here well those are the two lions that I  brought when I was in South Africa I  paid $16 million for two lions you at  all scared I don't think I all asde like  really being serious let so we're in  South Africa we go to the lion what's it  called the lion lion Park we to Lion  Park and they're like oh man we going to  take you Kevin we're going to show you  the real deal you got the VIP treatment  we going to take you out there with the  Lions and I was like okay I don't know  what happened I blacked out and these  guys made us feel so comfortable but it  was by far the stupidest thing I've ever  done it has it would have to be it's the  stupidest thing at any point in time you  got to understand them Lions can have a  bad day and we all just lost sight of  reality we were in the Lions then  walking with the lions like that's me  really standing in between two lions  good Lord yeah it was the stupidest  thing I've ever done some allstar game  high jinkx LeBron James what is he doing  he's taking your drink he's thirsty uh  you know me and Brian have a great  relationship I was at the All-Star game  I'm sitting Courtside and I talk a lot  of trash and uh I said something to  LeBron and he was like you had too much  to drink and he uh he took my drink he  took my drink he cut you off during the  game he cut me off and he he took the  drink down and he gave it the drink  and then I just look down drink and  sipping my drink and he's like you had  enough so this one is high river Rogue  okay it's kind of now we're going up a  little  bit spicy  [Music]  one catching you catching  you so I can ask you about hanging out  with celebrities all day but we don't  have all day so I just want to ask you  about one and that's Diddy and when I  think about guys who are like no sleep  and just operating on This brilliant  manic energy I think about Diddy and I  think about Kevin Hart do you feel like  you connect on the same wavelength when  you guys are

always wants to go  above and beyond the same thing with hve  you know I can go down a list Oprah I  can go on and on Tyler Perry about some  of the people that I personally look at  Steve Harvey that have been mentors that  have taken me to the side and had  amazing conversations with me you you  look at them in awe but in the same  sentence and the same voice you let them  know I want to get to where you are I'm  following your lead of course I'm  redirecting and doing things my way but  just know that your moves are being  watched by a student I'm a student of  the game those are people that have  played the game very well respect you  ready to move on NOP but I'm going to do  it so this one is 100% pain W like  here's my thing  where and  what  [ __ ] I know my we going to make it  bab you don't mind I have a question for  chocolate  dropper  got real that  [ __ ] in hip-hop there's all these  Regional reputations right New York's a  little bit cocky here La you have the  gangster rap Houston chopped in milk but  your hometown of Philly is Ground Zero  for battle rappers chocolate drop in  your opinion why is your  hometown so great at ethering  people I couldn't hear

]  Lips My Lips feel like they bleeding I  don't know what's going on  man uh Philadelphia is just a uh hey  man I'm proud of the just the the stance  that battle rap has in Philadelphia you  know people know that we get busy and I  I say we because I'm speaking on behalf  of my brother  dropper he's one of the realest man I'm  I'm happy for that dude to see him come  and get to where he's now got he's  finally getting the respect that he  deserves one of the real hards out there  I thought y'all was saying look like  it's going to go away go let's do it  just don't touch your eyes yeah start  touching your eyes Oh I thought y I was  like what I'm bleeding  what here's my thing when people create  this is it just to like is it just to  it's like to be [ __ ] I think that  actually is when you get to here you'd  never put this on a sandwich it's for  psychos it's for people who burned  out I see why I called the bomb cuz that  [ __ ] just blew  up one of the things that I admire about  you most is your ability to always look  at the glasses half full to take all  these negative experi is and turn them  into a positive so I want to give you a  few between a rock and a hard place  scenarios and you tell me how you would  spin it into a positive does that sound  good getting booed off  stage give me give me a water man see me  over here struggling  [ __ ] huh what we say oh [ __ ] you say  what so I want to give you a few between  a rock and a hard place scenarios and  you tell me how you'd look at it as  glass half full sound good y getting  boot off stage  okay it ain't that bad not that bad all  right here's how brother my tongue a my  tongue ain't working mhm I have lost  taste this this I'm going numb brother  okay here's the thing it's not that bad  reason why it's not that bad is because  you learn from it you can't get smacked  in the face and just hold your face you  got to go oh [ __ ] well just in case say  go to swing again how do I move and how  can I smack back everything is about  countering and figuring out how about uh  ripping a loud fart in class in front of  your  crush yeah brother [ __ ] happens you got  you got to take that baby you know  that's that's what I did I I say that  now you know that's how I got my wife  I'm gassy I'm going be gassy today I  tell you that what about when you do  that thing where someone waves at you  but they're actually waving at the  person behind them but you think they  were waving at you so you wave back and  then you guys are kind of caught in that  weird thing where they're like dude I  wasn't waving at you and then it's  comfortable for everybody just put your  hand in your pocket just keep them in  your pockets the way back at anyone soon  as you turn around just put your hand in  your pocket brother how many times have  you done this so I've done this 40 times  you're number 40 oh  [Music]  [ __ ] what's that one this is Mad Dog 357  yeah I tell  you I can't even cheat they

Dog 357 huh I sound like a  black dude made this  [Music]  [ __ ] so there always seems to be two  approaches to fashion and comedy right  you can either dress like you and Eddie  Murphy guys who dress like Superstars  but the rest of the comedians they all  dress like schlubs probably to seem more  relatable can you tell me the process  that you go through and you P out your  outfit for a soldout show cuz you seem  to think it through more so then say  Louis  CK well oh [ __ ] uh-huh that was the one  right there boy mhm that took you over  the top is I feel like my teeth coming  out hold on I'm about to answer it I  just got it yeah just got to find it I  got to get the answer for you brother  hold on  mhm oh [ __ ] clothes are very important  to me I feel like your clothes are a  clear  representation of who you  are I'm on  stage I love to feel good I love to look  good I love to look confident my clothes  play a major part in that I'm a stylish  cat so hey  man Wing number

everyone else I saw  your one chip challenge so I have an  idea but I do have to ask how are you  with spicy food I don't eat spicy food  however  I got embarrassed about cuz I promised I  wouldn't make a face on eating those  wings I'm guaranteed on this show I will  not make a  [Music]  face just take a little bite mhm like  that I really take a bitee  [Music]  so you're one of the most accomplished  players in NBA history you could  probably do a whole episode around your  Hall of Fame career do you remember the  first time you ever smashed a backboard  into a th000 pieces in high school in  San Antonio Texas but it was a cheat  dunk uh I couldn't dunk till my senior  year so my junior year we used to dump  off what they call apple boxes yeah we  have some onet I used to put an Apple  box in and imagine that I was in the NBA  so one day I ran and took off and I hung  on the rim and it broke and the glass  shattered and we ran  out the next day the uh gym teacher came  right to me and said I know you broke  the backboard and he says you know what  if you break a real backboard next year  when you starting on Varsity I won't be  upset so every time I got in the game My  senior I would try to dunk and dunk and  then one game in my senior year I broke  it took that one down too and I ran to  the gym coach and he gave me a hug  finally you did an amazing sit down  interview with Kobe Bryant last year  where you two reconciled some of your  differences what was the most we never  we never had any differences you know  people need to understand that in any  relationship there's going to be some T  turmoil but when you don't have respect  then comes differences we always had  respect we just had a a a difference of  opinion problems would be us winning no  championship chips at all not three out  of four I mean like I always told people  like even though we had our differences  it's not like I'm going to see him at a  restaurant eating and then be like give  me this chicken wing give me this second  chicken wing little Kobe and and bite to  it it's always about respect so working  it working it working  [Music]  it this one's a little hotter but I'm  not going to make a face  we allowed to drink water you can if you  want actually I'm not cuz water is going  to activate it you're trying to trick me  cuz that's what happened on TNT when I  bit into that ghost pepper chip I was  fine but it got caught my thr it was the  Water full and then yeah yeah so the  water activated it so I'm not going to  let nothing activate it to so there's a  lot of debate about which NBA players  can actually rap from Iman chumper to  Alan Iverson to Damen Lillard and I'm  curious is the only player to actually  land a recording deal with a major label  which NBA players would you allow in  your Cipher I mean I probably would  allow all of them I I never wanted a  album  deal arcenio Hall asked me to come on a  show and I was introducing the world to  Shaquille there I was like you know I  don't want to come on your show and just  be in the suit flashing money and  talking about what I'm going to do I  want to be different I said so I'll do  your interview but afterwards you got to  let me rap with my favorite rap group so  for me it was just a dream to raap in my  favorite rap group so I did it here's  the clip right here check it out  [Laughter]  so after that uh the next day people uh  called me and said hey we want to want  to give you a three album deal $10  million never going to turn that down  y'all get me all my favorite people that  I want to rap with be part of completing  my dreams and it'll work also I realized  when you go platinum I made one or two  million that's not enough money for me  so I was like you know this is fun but I  don't I don't want to be a rapper I just  want to have fun doing it just like  DJing I don't want to be the greatest DJ  in the world I want to go out and get  that that feeling of a game seven when  you see all those people that paid all  that money to watch you perform I got to  give them a show give me the ball I see  some kids out there jumping they want me  to score that's what it's all about for  me just you know all about just  basically having fun and then in  addition to your own platinum records  you've been name checked by some of the  biggest rappers ever from biggie to Lil  Wayne to 50 Cent do you have a favorite  Shack lyric I'm slamming like Shaquille  B I can say it but you can't say  it oh almost made bone up you almost got  me ah which one is  this right there pepper garlic  grapefruit onions and  carrots still no  face so you've established yourself as  something of a financial Guru for a lot  of younger players but is it true that  you blew a million dollars within 45  minutes of signing with the magic in 92  yeah that's true what' you buy I bought  a black 600 SEC Mercedes cuz cuz one  thing I forgot about is f you know who f  is you didn't know about the taxes yeah  I didn't know I didn't even know who F  was so and then I had no negotiating  skill like I probably could have got the  car down to 120 but the guy's like yeah  one one 138 in each equal out to 150  I'll take it black one with the wheels  had to pull out had to pull out Alpine  deck you remember that the one you pull  out with the leather case so I I pull up  to my dad's house and he said where's  mine at so I'm like in my mind a million  minus 150 I got 850 left I'm still Rich  so I go buy him one my mom want one so I  got her the little one which is about  100 so I was left for about 600 so then  after you know we showing off our cars I  was like I'll be back go to the mall  nice little Rolex bust down hunt it some  earrings hunt it give me a four finger  ring 150 give me some shoes give me a  couple suits hit my boys off with a  couple stacks you know and then I got a  call from the uh president of of the  bank on the army base the next day he's  like you 50,000 in the hole I was like  no you're you're wrong cuz in my mind I  I thought I had a million but so when we  went and looked at the paperwork I was  50,000 ho cuz I was just writing checks  like crazy and my parents have  always raised me using Scare Tactics  because uh 75% of all professional  athletes when they're done 5 years after  they're done have nothing and they  didn't want me to be like that so I had  to hire a business manager I think it  was a great lesson I have six children  and I want them to respect more than  just having their daddy a sha like when  I come into the parent teacher meetings  and they call me Dr O'Neal gets me hard  not this hard this hard just you know  what I'm hard so I just cuz it's out of  respect of course your daddy Shaq and he  did a lot but your father also has a  doctorate father also owns businesses  your father is also very respectful he's  very charitable I want them to see me as  as more than just a a retired great  basketball  [Music]  player this one's a little spy here  okay which one this  one CH  [Music]  gold  b  b still not making a face though NOP  still holding strong so the mythology  around you is so enormous that the only  way to get to the truth is to fact check  the legend himself so here I'll hit you  with some Larger than Life Shack I  almost made a face go ahead and you just  tell me if it's Truth or Fiction okay is  it true that you once saved Carlos men's  life when he was getting savagely  heckled by Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg at a  comedy show  yeah yeah he did a joke that was  borderline and they was getting ready to  check them so I just you know help him  get out the back door fact or fiction  you used to have police lights on your  truck and you talking pulled over Darius  miles on the freeway and made him late  for Clippers practice remember that cuz  if I wasn't working that day I'd get in  trouble so I'm just going that fiction  that one fiction I'm just going to  record and say I refuse to answer any  questions on the grounds that it may  incriminate me is it I refuse to answer  any questions on the  grounds is it true that you have the  record for the largest singular purchase  in Walmart history yes that's true I got  traded from Miami to Phoenix and I had  an apartment that I got in one day was  three bedroom lights apartment when when  I shop I don't shop I already know what  I want when I go there and I just go get  it so if I got to get towels I'm just  going  to 30 towels 30 little towels I need  pots p grab it what got me was the TVs  cuz I ordered about six TVs that's what  got me we'll catch up with you 70 grand  67000 did you give Paul Pierce's  nickname the truth yes CU I don't look  at scy Port cuz it don't matter cuz  every time I go play against a player he  reminds me of this the barbecue chicken  my that's what I'm doing any player that  ont I don't care hot you are how cold  you are this what I'm  doing the other ones I just took a back  with this one the whole thing no face no  face so he  played when he was doing work that game  I was like you know what this kid is the  truth is it true that you gave in sync  their first Big Break by having them  record in your home studio after you saw  him perform the national anthem at an  Orlando Magic game was one of my worst  music career  mistakes ever I could have signed them  and Back Street Boys I think I let him  record my studio for a dollar but I just  didn't understand that music and my  biggest mistakes not investing in  Starbucks not signing in snake and Back  Street  [Music]  Boys we're on five Shacks on six working  ahead but we have a recurring segment on  our show called explain that gram where  we do a deep dive on our guest Instagram  pull interesting pictures that need more  context so out the laptop I'll show you  the picture you just tell me the bigger  story does that sound good am I eating  or you want me to wait well you could  chill on that if you want to oh you want  me to wait I'm moving too fast for you a  little hot I I'm trying to keep up I'm  on my heels over here still haven't made  a face  America all right check first things  first America should I drink some water  or not it activates it me take a little  no I ain't going to take off that what's  going on here looks like you're hoisting  grank yeah grank is the strongest white  dude I've ever felt not felt let me take  that  back C is the strongest white guy I've  ever picked up he's very strong he likes  to party I like the party and this was  my first Shacks fun house in Miami it  was cool until he started doing pelvic  thrusts behind my head like if you hold  somebody up and they don't move it's  cool but once they start doing the you  know the pelvic threats I had to had to  put them down yeah yeah I had to put  them down Yao Ming is the same size is  my favorite Convenience St 7-Eleven yes  he's really 7-Eleven he likes to say  he's 76 [ __ ] can I say [ __ ] in  the show Absolutely it's internet Let it  Fly he's way up there oh my God he's and  he just dwarfs me so every time I see  him I got to take a picture is this in  Shanghai or where in Shanghai every time  I go to China I uh reach out to him  because funny story I kind of got in  trouble for this but right I wasn't  being like they they uh they used the  word racist but it was far from that so  when I was growing up all the Chinese  movies were like this you want me to eat  your hot wing they were like that right  so I was just trying to I was just  trying to you know have some fun y' me  you dare come to the US and you want a  battle check so I was doing stuff like  that so my father got really upset and  he said you shouldn't do that and I said  why I'm just he said because of When ya  Ming was young he used to write me  letters well he's said man this kid been  idolizing you I didn't want to tell you  but he's been idolizing you write letter  show them a little bit more I was just  you know I'm just trying to you know I'm  sha Fu and you come from over there so  but people you know they they actually  you know took it the wrong way but my  father's very upset he said you need to  show this young man so when I got home  he he used to send me Christmas cards  yeah you guys have really cool  relationship yeah yeah so every time I  go to China I just try to you know reach  out to them do you remember giving me a  smooch that was you on the top of the  head I didn't recognize you it was you  this is at the Super Bowl a few years  ago bastard you try to squish it up with  the  beer trying to come in here and tell me  your name was America he told me he was  Justin Timberlake he sent the email and  said Justin Timberlake want to interview  you I have a confession yes These Wings  Are not cold they're hot I'm sweating  and my boys are sweating that's how hot  they are I'll let you figure out what my  boys are  [Music]  which one was that Yobo Loco Koh kid out  of Hawaii almost made a  face almost made a  face God darn mhm this is the one that  I'm scared of the next one pan in get  the scare  [Music]  face so as we touched on in your intro  Inside the NBA it's won nine Emmy Awards  and I'm sure I'm not alone and thinking  that it's the best sports show on TV how  has your attitude towards the sports  press shifted since becoming an analyst  like are you more sympathetic to the  sports media now than you were during  your playing days no I realize that  everyone has a job to do being in the  game for a long time I could tell who's  being personal and who's not I have the  ability to when I hear criticism I turn  off being Shaq for a while and then my  intelligence kicks in like Shaq's a  great player but so then I'm just focus  on the but I am a great player but  they're right I'm only shooting 45% from  the free throw line so there's some  validity here when he said that then I  turned the shack back on I won't be  upset I want to do a thought exercise I  want you to think about if Twitter and  Instagram existed when you were in the  NBA would that be good for Shaq or would  that be bad for Shaq it it'll be both I  always say what's on my  mind and sometimes you have to be  politically correct sometimes I am  sometimes I'm not but as far as  advertising and marketing I definitely  would have been a trillionaire by now  but also would have got into some  trouble you know I always tell people  especially when I'm doing speeches yeah  I'm Shaq I'm nice but don't put anybody  on the pedestal shck you ready to move  on I'm waiting on you  Timberlake which one is it the garlic  Reaper so it's the garlic  Reaper my boys are sweating real  bad  oh you tricked me  oh  [Music]  my I'm not going to make a face  off so since retiring from the NBA  you've launched this second career in  law  enforcement working as a reserved  officer in several cities and then even  last year becoming an honorary Deputy in  Clayton County Georgia I'm a real  Deputy what advice do you have for  talking your way out of a speeding  ticket I'm still not making a face  though I don't talk my way out of speed  and tickets  because police officers have it hard and  people have it hard if he pulled me over  I probably did it and this comes from  being raised by a drill sergeant you  show every man respect you show every  woman respect so when I get pulled over  yes sir no sir I have a I have a badge  but I don't it um and then I asked him  did I do something wrong you were  speeding my bad I apologize they give me  a ticket take it have a great day be  safe that's what it's all about ain't  about I'm this and that you got time for  that cuz those people have jobs to do  also right those people are under a lot  of stress I ain't trying to get blown  away and then you've made some noise  about possibly running for sheriff in  2020 I'm going to do it in 2024 2024 I  think I spoke too early cuz I got a lot  going on right now and when I become  Sheriff I want to be there for the  people like right now I'm DJing doing it  like I can't I I don't want to be I  don't want to be that guy I thought I  thought this was hot this is nothing I  over I over exaggerate  it the bomb Beyond Insanity hot  [Music]  sauce where you be getting all this  stuff from that's from  Kansas Kansas don't know how to do no  hot wings  [Music]  Kansas oh I apologize Kansas  boy it's time to reach for that jug you  lied to me you  oh oh gu what got me  God all right Shaq you [ __ ] liar Sha  it's undeniable one of the  great of our era but with the  proliferation of the internet and camera  phones there's so much more than what's  just on the NBA on TN or ESPN so what  we're going to do [ __ ] Li is show you  some of the great internet best of the  worst basketball clips and I just want  you to react to what you're seeing how  you doing Shaq all right  all right  Shaq does this take you back I'm not  watching that right now does this take  you back to your high school  days that's exactly what  happened all right up  next preparing for a potential  [Music]  rebound second free throw my goodness

touched on many  aspects of your multi-prong career but  you can go down so many radical with all  that you've touched outside the court  and inside the court as one of the most  pedigreed practical jokers what's the  best prank you've ever pulled on Charles  Barkley welcome to Shaq's edition of  snotty nose wings  I feel like snotty pipping up here  evening can't tell you what Charles  doesn't

look like  uh probably the Barry of friend video I  don't know if any of You' seen it came  out a couple days ago mhm it would be in  the realm of that everybody thinks I  sold my soul to the Illuminati I don't  really know what the Illuminati is to be  honest with you that's what somebody  would say if they sold their soul to the  Illuminati would you ever want to design  a video game yeah that'd be so sick oh  my God  see I used to play like not really the  classics I kind of I would play like I  used to play ELO Milo a  lot I loved ELO Milo that was like my  favorite game in the world H do you know  what that game is no it's this game  School me where it's these two little  boo boos they're these little they're so  cute they're these little creatures one  is named ELO and the other's named Milo  it's this sort of anti-gravity world  where there's all these little blocks  and they start apart from each other and  the idea is you you just get to each  other and then when they get to each  other they just hug and they this little  dance and that's the whole game there's  no prize you just get to each other so  the whole idea is the game is just like  losing the person you love and then  finding them again it's so cute and uh I  used to play Red Dead Redemption that  [ __ ] was [ __ ] hard but I only played  it to ride the  horses well sheali  Andes I'm doing good you're doing so  good I don't feel [ __ ]  [Music]  did you speak too soon  no all right Billy we have a current  segment on our show called explain that  Graham where we do a deep dive on our  guest Instagram pull interesting  pictures that need more context so I'll  bust out the laptop I'll show you the  picture you just tell me the bigger  story does that sound good  yeah all right  Billy you're are hanging out with  tekashi Mami so insane did you guys talk  about anime and sneakers uhhuh literally  but he doesn't really speak English and  I don't speak Japanese so there's a lot  of  like non-verbal communication yeah but  he he is like one of the most humble  pieces of art I've ever seen in my life  he he walks around Barefoot with his  little dog Palm yep I went to this like  other Studio I feel like I'm going to  faint I went to this other Studio  careful around your eyes too Billy  making me nervous with you know the hot  sauce  okay um I was we went to this other  Studio which was like a motion capture  studio and they put me in like a full  body like tight full body motion  capturing outfit so it was like I was  like up in there up in that [ __ ] Kim  Kardashian feel me like with the like  the tight like almost like leather like  whatever it was and then they put these  little balls all over me like little  white balls stuck them to me and on the  screen was like an anime like an anime  just like walking around and I was like  that's so sick cuz this [ __ ] was like  slim thick and stuff like she was just  like on the wall just like and but they  that was like you from the well I didn't  know what it was it was just like this  anime doll that looked bomb and then I  lifted my arm up and she lifted her arm  up that was [ __ ] crazy and then it  all connected sense mhm and then I just  did the whole thing and it was like  automatically coped being what I was  doing with the anime doll thing on it  was crazy that's sick it was  crazy do you have a favorite memory from  the second annual Brock Hampton prom  night um I forgot the whole bridge in  copycat the whole thing and the audience  hated it that's all I remember audience  hated it but they're dope though every  single one of them sweethearts like just  the nicest dudes shout out Brock Hampton  shout out Brock  Hampton I'm going drink water anymore  I've decided Well let's see if you stick  with  that how do you do this stuff week in  and week out it's just you know don't  you feel that way sometimes too though  when you're like oh it's a full press  day then I've got this tour and then  this thing and that and then you're like  how do do you enjoy this yeah any job  turns into a job especially when you're  eating spicy ass chicken wings every  week for the internet's  Amusement you must experience that I do  all time I mean it's like it's a lot of  bad [ __ ] but it's also a lot of good  [ __ ] that you can't get without the bad  [ __ ] and you wouldn't trade it you know  like there's nothing else I want right  could would you go back you know like  how much would you have to get paid to  go back and have to go through it all  again but then I wouldn't trade with  anyone for where I am mm- mm- agreed  yeah I get that mhm I get existential  conversation that we're having over  gluten-free nugs over here so many  artists obsess about the idea of being  misunderstood or having words mangled  but you seem to almost invite it I mean  this is why I'm okay with people  thinking I've been sold to the  Illuminati or whatever because it's  like art is up for inter it should be up  for interpretation I don't I don't want  to see somebody say this is my theory  about what the song is about and then  have a whole thing and me be like that's  not what it's about I think that's so  boring one of my favorite Parts about  making music is that people take it in  the way that they take it and I have no  control over  that it's so hard to form a sentence  right  now but yeah like everything's up for  [Music]  interpretation it's a heart  [Applause]  put it in  rotation okay keep asking me things mhm  so it wouldn't be a hot ones interview  unless we took a wing to obsess on food  preferences do you remember what you  were eating when you tweeted food is  such a powerful little  hoe what she could take control of  anyone I think I was eating Taco Bell  it was either Taco Bell  or a burrito from my house where does  creating the Billy a donut for donut  friend rank in your list of career  accomplishments that's a big one I got  boobs on my shirt by the way  it's damn it this really burning my lips  up here mhm in an interview with vanity  fair you said that the only time that  you don't get recognized is when you're  in Trader Joe's you know what it's not  safe I was going to say do you feel a  freedom when you're walking the aisles  at tjs or not so much not anymore not  anymore not even Costco I went to Costco  on my  birthday  because I'm just I'm doing this for my  lips because my lips are very  um spiced out it  happens and I don't want to lick them  [ __ ]  can I just dip my lips in this hold on  you know

wow  [Music]  o  [Music]  instant  yeah I don't even tast it no all right  Billy well it's clear sitting across  from you the drip it's a sight to behold  but your fans know that you're more  likely to be elbow deep in a Bargain Bin  than buying out the Gucci store how do  you distinguish between a steel and a  ripoff when it comes to vintage designer  [Music]  gear I can't do this this is really  crazy it's crazy it's crazy I'm sorry I  can't I can't I can't I can't I can I  can I can't I can no I can't I really  can't can we get some director's  commentary from some of our favorite  Billy

guard throw it into the crowd my beanie  who does that it's my bey right I was  pissed you off at this  point and I was screaming and I was  really angry and I was with young blood  you know what that is MHM tons of like  bad [ __ ] did I just hit you with the  water I I ducked it like the Matrix  okay God why am I telling the story then  I got up does it all relate to this pick  yeah it does no it

Ariana Grande fans have  you ever use the Billy ish Twitter Army  for evil they do it I mean I don't even  have to say anything they do it on their  own they really do it on their own  obviously I go on it cuz like an  instinct but  I don't say anything I feel I don't  share anything with the internet I've  heard you say that you love being judged  do you think that it's important to  listen to your  haters not to listen but to to find  humor in  it I used to be like I love  hate huh it's like the junior mins and  it's like the it's like the yes the  chips you got to be careful when you ask  for you got to be careful I don't know  man  [Music]  this is the last dab we call it the last  dab because it's tradition around here  to put a little extra on the last vegan  nugget you don't have

29th when we all fall asleep where  do we  go I go to hell when I  die so does  he good job Billy good  job hey what's going on everybody for  first we Feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with hot  questions and even hotter wings and it's  a ban our day in Internet history as we  open up season 8 with Gordon Ramsey  he's one of the world's most decorated  and successful chefs with an Empire that  includes more than a dozen restaurants  countless best-selling cookbooks and  seven hit TV shows including Master Chef  Jr which returns to Fox this February  Gordon Ramsey welcome to the show great  to see you so we started hot ones about  four years ago and shortly after we put  up our first episode we were bombarded  with requests to get Gordon Ramsey on  the show and as the show has grown so  too has that albatross around our necks  which has followed me from the internet  to the airport to my family get  togethers so this one is very much for  the fans I'm nervous in a good way but  at the same time I feel like a weight  has been lifted off my shoulder so I  just want to say thank you for coming in  today you're welcome good to see you  congrats by the way uh season 8 amazing  um I have four kids they're pay me to  come on this Dad I want to see how good  your palette is or how strong your  palette is youve got a big mouth uh you  shout and scream all day long but can  you take a hot wing so finally under  immense pressure from the family and a  lot of supporters out there I'm here the  world has pressured us into this room  Gordon that is it if it all goes tits up  after this it doesn't matter we made the  hot ones okay  [Music]  okay so how long were These Wings cooked  for uhoh I knew that this was going to  happen Dam yeah cuz a bit [ __ ]  overcooked it's like eating a mouthful  of [ __ ]  [Music]  sand a good Wing look at your arms  that's a good Wing right there yeah yeah  but so it needs a bit meat on there it's  [ __ ] things like a  quail so Gordon as we mentioned in your  intro Master Chef Jr comes back next  month one of your many shows that become  a global phenomenon when you think back  in all the times you've been wowed by  the Raw Talent of a child on that show  is there a story that stands out um I  think of some of the uh earlier kids now  um you know back on season 1 yeah  they're into the 18 19 year old um  Alexander from season 1 and you know  this guy is a prolific Chef he's barely  19 years of age and for the last 5 years  he spent weekends and holidays in some  of the most amazing restaurants across  the world so I say to them no Mom no dad  no school teacher you're going to love  me you're going to hate me it's going to  be the best football coach you've ever  met in your life but you'll come out of  this and much better cook and they do  what's been the most disturbing thing  that you've ever seen unnoticed or  uncared for at a restaurant on Kitchen  Nightmares uh that's a really good  question so um I went into a  refrigeration unit once and saw a tartar  sauce 3 and a half years out of date how  [ __ ] dumb must you be to use this  tartar sauce that stank to use a sauce  that's festering bubbling like something  out [ __ ] Harry Potter that was off 3  years ago y um several St Littles  spotted in the corner of the kitchen  yeah big [ __ ] they're like cats  I didn't know they only had cats they  didn't it was it was a [ __ ] rats yeah  pretty shocking uh from rats to mold uh  to recently  um coming across a restaurant with  plastic cheese over nachos covered in  mold do you have any idea how long  cheese needs to sit in a fridge that's  plastic cheese to get mold [ __ ] years  years  hippie dippy green what are they smoking  when they come up with these names  probably opium  opium okay so the restaurant business is  notoriously difficult with these thin  margins and then of course Infinite  Space for human error and then when  you're a chef who's famous and has this  large empire that goes across several  continents you end up being a target for  the type of yelper or Trip Advisor  commenter that's like this place is a  total ripoff I could have made it for $3  can you explain in layman's terms the  basic math behind how a $25 cheeseburger  might end up on a menu mhm I've seen  chefs with freaking gold leaf on a  burger to get to the $100 Mark which is  a bit stupid really CU you don't go and  eat a [ __ ] burger with gold leaf uh  and why taint that flavor so uh $25  Burger it's all about the Patty the  thickness the blend it depends on  whether it's a Chuck the short rib a  great bage bun and how you lay that up  with you know all the the trappings of a  luxurious Burger is there a hidden cost  in running a restaurant that most diners  are unaware of yeah it's called rent and  labor cost um two big key factors in  running a successful business um  landlords uh they win either way so the  more successful you are the more rent  they ask for uh the less successful you  are uh the more demanding they are for  the rent so the great way of identifying  a classy restaurant is being full on a  Monday night Friday Saturday will look  that will take care of itself uh  naturally if you can fill it Monday  Tuesday Wednesday you're 90% of the way  there [ __ ] grapefruit in a hot sauce  are you serious I know that you spent  your early years studying classic French  technique you're bouncing around  restaurants in London and Paris working  alongside some of the most influential  chefs in the world so with that in mind  I want to bounce some of the people some  of the mentors that helped shape Gordon  Ramsay into this battle Harden  perfectionist that we see today I'm just  curious what you learned about cooking  what you learned about business maybe  even what you learned about life from  each okay we'll start with Marco Pierre  White mhm [ __ ] phenomenon uh a  nutbuster uh ball breaker super talented  Chef if you thought my performance  sometimes was shocking in the kitchen  that was a [ __ ] Hollywood Blockbuster  right there Oscar nominated marip white  um that guy had finesse he could close  his eyes and dress a plate beautifully  uh and it could come out looking like a  Gucci handbag I mean stunning how about  G kisawa was amazing it was like this  perfect Frenchman that was you hard as  [ __ ] on the outside and then you look at  him it's the kind of guy that your  grandma would take to the [ __ ] Bingo  we had one and a half days off a week  that half a day if you took that half  day you're [ __ ] so you had to be in  there no pay uh and showing willingness  you know to learn and as a as as an  English cook in a French kitchen I had  to bust my ass off twice as hot now you  know one of the best chefs living today  uh and still a prominent figure uh an OD  Cuisine how about Joel Ruban rashan was  a task masker combined uh Marco Tony  Baine uh geir alberu all together and  you've got Joe roban because you know on  the outside world it was this incredible  successful genius but behind the scenes  oh my God you know from ravioli flying  over your head to [ __ ] copper pans to  I used to see ducks flying from one end  of the kitchen to the other thinking  they'd just reborn their [ __ ] Wings  the only thing was missing with the  feathers I remember telling me that the  best thing ever happened to was the [ __ ]  that ran down my mother's leg when she  gave birth to me how did you get up in  the morning and concentrate at work the  next day on that one then  so for all those beautiful Millennials  and snowflakes out there trust me the  more you get pushed the thicker your  skin the thicker your skin trust me the  higher you  [Music]  go cha gold from where out of New Jersey  right CH gold and do you mind if I  sponsor the wings going forward you like  pay for some [ __ ] decent meat on the  bones that would be a dream come true  for  us we trade emails we'll trade emails so  that's nippy at the beginning it's like  nip nip nip nip immediately so it's not  a  yeah it's fine right mhm it's not it's  not super hot so with your many  best-selling cookbooks then your how-to  tutorials online you've inspired a  generation maybe several how to up their  food game but today we want to give a  lesson to the spice Lords can you break  down the perfect Gordon ramsy at home  burger and describe how to make it in as  much detail as possible yeah um so for  me it's about that blend I would go uh  60 G beef 10% fat blend that with 10%  Chuck and then I would do almost like a  luxurious for rib in there and then the  last part somewhat lean so a bit of a TR  tip in there in a way that it sort of  holds that thing together so it's tight  the cigar are great burgers in the  seasoning and so too many people make  the burger but they don't season it  properly so season this thing chili  flakes garlic powder salt  pepper severe sear strong caramelization  on on top and then it's the basting and  so once you've caramelized that burger  on top don't worry about it still being  raw inside you baste cuz as you base  that butter it seeps through and becomes  so much more richer the fat caramelizes  on top of the burger so the flavor layer  is beautiful Brios bun beauy toasted and  then baked so not only is it toasted but  it holds substantially all those juices  the most important thing about a burger  let that thing rest before you bite into  it and that's what happens sometimes  they cook the burger they bite in the  middle oh man it's all pissing out yeah  yeah let it rest let it sit inside there  um and then stack it  [Music]  beautifully so you made this one and uh  it's out a [ __ ] date 2017 can't you  afford [ __ ] sauce in dates uhoh you  know what these are just stage bottles  oh good yeah  [ __ ] here we go  so oh that's quite nice I like that you  do yeah that's quite zesty that's that's  fruity I like that smoked sanos some  orange in there aot yeah I mean I'm not  too sure about apricot  but big big that's good thank you much  now it's getting hotter yep yeah a  little bit of sort of um um it's  starting to move on the armpits I'm  sweating that's how we do it here Gordon  all right Gordon we have aent segment on  our show called explain that gram we do  a deep dive on our guest Instagram pull  interesting pictures that need more  context so I'll bust out the laptop I'll  show you the picture you just tell me  the bigger story does that sound good  yes  sir how you doing so far BR you really  dive on people's [ __ ] Instagram  what's wrong with you did your  girlfriend  know okay Gordon first things first do  you remember this meeting of the minds  courts side at the Lakers game you David  Beckham and Kobe  Bryant I got absolutely [ __ ] there  really yeah because five minutes prior  to that I threw the first ball out at  the Dodger Stadium the game was so  [ __ ] boring DB text me say fancy he  basketball so I went to the basketball I  got into such trouble cuz you can't go  from throwing the first pitch out then  going watching the [ __ ] basketball 10  minutes later can you well you can  apparently no not good um so um yeah sat  ringside there it was the first time in  my life at 6'2 I felt like a short ass  everyone's [ __ ] 7t tall it's no  longer down there it's like [ __ ] so uh  love the game um and and uh yeah Kobe  what an athlete Jesus uh incredible do  you remember this lunch service at  Downing Street with Tony Blair and  Vladimir Putin yeah I mean quite  honestly probably the first time as a  chef I stood between two guys customers  actually shat myself thinking this could  go off any  minute entering down his street uh  getting pelted by there the supporters  outside they anti Putin and anti BL ever  since that day I've never got involved  in politics right based on that lunch  can you imagine turning one of those  leaders ill based on a [ __ ] bad  oyster or a [ __ ] chicken wing we didn't  serve chicken wings there by the way I  did the I did the most amazing Panos sea  bass with a comfy tomato and a beautiful  shellfish uh vinegret and we finished  with a bakeable tart so I remember the  menu you know as if it was last week  powerful lunch but couldn't wait to get  the [ __ ] out of there  [Music]  yeah okay that's hot now tingling  everywhere yeah in the back half here  mhm yeah mhm  yeah Okay so we've talked a lot about  your tangible accomplishments Michelin  stars TV ratings but I'm curious about  some of the more unusual highlights and  low lights from your life okay of the  following Daredevil moments which was  more intense hunting down a burmes  python butchering a wild boar or  tracking down puffins in Iceland um yeah  I have to say tracking down puffins in  Iceland I mean don't forget this is how  this country lived you know for for for  for for decades that level of protein  across those winter months is brutal so  um sort of hanging off a 600 met High  Cliff uh with a rope and a a [ __ ] net  catching this furry bird to eat um I  made this amazing uh dish [ __ ] that's  hot that thing by the way [ __ ] it's  starting to come through now what are  you laughing at h  [ __ ] yeah you take a big deep breath so  um I made this amazing uh puffing salad  made this bread um and and and proved it  in this uh active volcano in Iceland dug  the hole stuck it in amongst these rocks  came back the next day the [ __ ] bread  was nicked someone stole it so I'm still  looking for that Viking that stole that  [ __ ] amazing loaf of bread bastards  [Music]  oh yeah mhm  yeah okay yeah that's moving yeah yeah  also it's just a little bit it's not  um not good that one is it it's a tough  one yeah it's a tough one also it's t  mhm so when people have reached their  peak in a profession whether it's Kobe  Bryant I think that's uh I feel like  that's burning a new ring on my [ __ ]  ass you and I both Gordon I to eye on  this one now I know what that [ __ ]  song means ring of fire was that Johnny  Cash I've got one on this [ __ ] seat  there's nothing coming through so we're  okay all right but everybody in  production be ready okay yeah ring a  fire holy [ __ ] yeah that's hot is  somebody with a foot in both worlds  who's more insufferable TV critics or  restaurant critics they're both Cut From  the Same Cloth cuz they're both standing  staring at you wish they could be you so  [ __ ] it take on the chin two piey in the  same pod well you know it seems like on  paper at least that you would enjoy the  linguistic flare of a good takeown so  I'm curious I want to hit you with a few  infamously Savage restaurant reviews and  I'm just curious how they hit your ear  from an insult level before you go there  I remember once uh the evening standard  years ago when I first opened and this  amazing food critic describe one of my  dishes around your eyes yeah [ __ ] yeah  looking like toxic scum on a stagnant  pool I'm like [ __ ] really that's how  you describe my [ __ ] dish toxic skull  and a stagnant pole [ __ ] did I really  hurt you that much let me bounce this  one off of you from Jay rer writing for  the guardian in 2013 he said of the  muscles at Leon de Brussels in London  the meat inside the shells is small and  shriveled and dry each shell contains  what looks like the retracted scrotum of  a hairless cat wow so that's Savage  right yeah so we can't talk about  critics like that but they can talk  about us like that I'm a firm believer  in keeping it professional but not per  person Al so I had a runin once with a  Critic and unfortunately I asked him to  leave uh but [ __ ] my heart's beating as  well like [ __ ] the drum what is going  on with these [ __ ] Wings did you make  this sauce this next one is from Pete  wells in the New York Times guy fettis  restaurant in Time Square why is one of  the few things on your menu that can be  eaten without fear or regret called a  roasted pork Bon me when it resembles  that item about as much as you resemble  Emily Dickinson Jesus Christ almighty  good morning glad you've had a [ __ ]  great day uh I know guy um but any chef  that turns around puts donkey sauce on  his [ __ ] menu you're going to get a  kick in okay cuz if my wife was sat  there thinking stheart I'm going to have  the ribs with a donkey sauce it doesn't  quite ring well does it you know [ __ ]  happens take it okay and shut the [ __ ]  up and then one more at the risk of  being a bit cheeky this one is from the  late Sunday Times writer AA girl about  your own restaurant oine in the 9s the  chef is a failed Sportsman who acts like  an 11-year-old M [ __ ] him  [Laughter]  [ __ ]  him yeah I didn't realize come of the  hot ones I leave with [ __ ] three  [ __ ] yeah I mean Jesus Christ it's  like have a [ __ ] nuclear lab look at  the label on that [ __ ] thing me huh  enhance my dreams yeah I mean the wings  are getting [ __ ] smaller and smaller  now they look like my [ __ ] Grandad's  no [ __ ] he [ __ ] big toe how do you  get a chicken we that looks like M  Grandad's big toe wait till you B into  it tastes like your grandfather's big  toe  we holy  [Music]  [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah that's like [ __ ]  sticking your tongue in a [ __ ] plate  of acid mhm Jesus Christ yes what's the  [ __ ] going to happen tomorrow when I'm  back behind the line tasting and  perfecting where the [ __ ] are you going  to be tomorrow cuz I mean I have to call  you [ __ ] I'll be in town I'll be in town  Gordon  and you're never one to mince words when  it comes to items that don't reach your  culinary standards whether it's pub food  that's laced and truffle oil or tasting  menus

      "page_content": "this is going to be spicier than the  last one I I might throw  [Music]  up hey what's going on everybody for  first week Feast I'm Sean Evans and  you're watching hot ones it's the show  with hot questions and even hotter wings  and today we're joined by Gwyneth paltro  she's an Oscar Golden Globe and Emmy  award-winning actor best Ling cookbook  author and the founder and CEO of the  Lifestyle brand goop which offers  everything from Beauty and wellness  products a fashion line Media Ventures  retail stores and even the take salads  that Susan loves so much Gwyneth palro  welcome to the show thanks for having me  how are you around hot sauce and are you  having any last second reservations  before we kick things off  here I am full of  regret I can't believe I'm here I'm here  because my son loves hot sauce and loves  this show  apparently I am not I do like hot sauce  I like  spicy but I don't think I'm equipped to  be  [Music]  here okay here we go  [Music]  okay that's very nice  [Music]  that's  spicy I thought you were going to start  real plain and like sort of Groom me  into the experience out of the frying  pan and Into the Fire show but you got  it okay is there a tension between  growth and preciousness of vision when  you're building a company like goop  especially like in today's  entrepreneurial environment where  everything is about scaling all the time  it's a really good question there is a  pressure there's a there's like a  natural sort of  tensegrity um which I think can be  difficult when you start a business just  all from like heart and wanting to  curate beautiful things and share the  best of everything with people and  sometimes the more commercial choice is  not the right choice I never want to let  our reader or our customer down in any  way never want to offer something or  recommend something that I don't 100%  believe in use love I'm obsessed with so  I it has I think made growth  slower very smoky  [Music]  smelling sort of like have this a jerky  esque thing happening yeah right right  and maybe even a little bit less hot  than the last one know I think we kind  of Jar are you here in the beginning and  you panic a little bit yeah but then  settling into the game here yeah have  your SE still have  a I still have a warm tingly sensation  that's the show it'll persist all right  I'm just trying to set expectations for  you  know why are you so passionate about hot  sauce you know what I I wasn't naturally  okay like the hot sauce just came  because we wanted to disrupt the pr  driven flight pattern of our guests  right yes so hot sauce does that or at  least we thought it might and then we've  been doing this for 23 Seasons so we  might be right on some level you know  what I'm saying so hot sauce was never  like it's not like I would loved hot  sauce and built a whole show around it I  kind of had to like become a lover of  hot sauce to keep it going you know what  I'm saying okay now do you put hot sauce  on everything I kind of do are you sick  of it wings I never want to see again in  my life like when I'm done with this  I've eaten over 3,000 chicken wings for  the internet's Amusement over the years  like I'm over those like you'll never  see me eat another Wing when this is  done right but I think my appreciation  for hot sauce is only grown because I've  seen the way that it transforms food and  talking to all these different Growers  and all these different craft makers so  I think it's actually strengthened the  appreciation I have for hot sauce Wings  dead to  me all right are you ready to move on  here to Sauce number three I guess  so funky Hot Sauce Funky hot sauce  Stellar fuzz yeah it's getting fun  is  it that's pretty good so in 2017 a study  was commissioned ranking American actors  British accents in leading roles for  films that grossed over $100 million  really yes okay and your performance in  Shakespeare and love actually finished  second behind only Merill streets  Margaret that  oh I'll go Toe to Toe with with you got  to take that I'll take it during your  acting Heyday how would you describe  your approach to mastering a character's  dialect okay this bug is not part of my  tasting menu right  um so it was interesting because I  didn't know I had kind of I have like a  relatively good ear for that kind of  thing so I had grown up you know making  prank calls doing accents that kind of  thing and like making my friends laugh  but it turns out that to actually do it  properly you have to relearn how to  speak so the English accent is so  different and the muscles are so  different like where you place the  tongue on the teeth and the mouth is so  different like certain muscles are more  relaxed and certain are more tense so  when you're in the country you get  that I think you got it die [ __ ]  um so I think you really get the  opportunity to use the language and  really  hear because it's so different when  you're in like an academic setting  trying to learn but you know as opposed  to being in  conversation oh green  chili  mhm right I can see the face you know a  little bit of a cumulative effect that  we have going on you know what I'm  saying is that is that what happens so  they all kind of uh will affect you  physically in different ways so you do  have a walls closing in situation going  on right and I feel that  way no I get it I get it so there are  certain goop products that have a larger  than life mythology in pop culture okay  what do you see is the role of  provocations in building a brander  movement um another great question  um so it's funny we never really set out  to be provocative we just wanted to talk  about things that people weren't talking  about and things that we think should be  um should not like be shrouded in shame  and I think you can only change Culture  by being provocative whether you mean to  or not we always say you know we we  believe that we're a provocator in the  cause for good um so it's not for its  own sake but really to bring like more  agency and you know individuality  [Music]  forward oh queso queso  okay okay and this is kind of a step mhm  up but I can see in your eyes  determination I feel determined I also  feel like I might pass out  right like I feel it's a thin line yeah  like my breathing is sort of an issue  but I'm sure it'll  pass fact or fiction kefir southernland  babysat you as a kid fact Isn't that  cool I was at Williamstown the  Williamstown theater Festival where my  mom was doing plays and he was an  apprentice and he babysat me and my  brother that's amazing he was awesome  how about this one this is kind of a  winding one I'm curious about this all  right so though shown in the movie that  there was a Gwyneth ptro prop head that  was made for that closing scene in seven  the Box scene in seven obviously not  used then but is it true that it then  sat in storage for 16 years to be  Unearthed and then used in the autopsy  scene in Contagion  oh wow well there was definitely a head  made for seven because I remember you  know they incon you in silicone or  whatever and I do think there's a single  frame of it used but it's like  imperceptible to the eye that's what  I've been  told um so you can freeze frame it some  and see if I can find it yeah I think  that's what I've heard and I'm not sure  about the  contagion one if they use that or not  the same head the same head the jury's  still out I mean that would be smart for  saving on budget I guess is it true that  uh Bill Clinton passed out of sleep  during a white house screaming of Emma  true he was snoring right in front of me  I was like wow I guess this is going to  be a real hit  movie but it was so [ __ ] you Bill  [Laughter]  Clinton oh God I like the bourbon part  right and then it kind of falls off a  cliff with the ingredients yeah  [Music]  so during his acceptance speech at last  night's Academy Awards American fiction  director C Jefferson made a plea to  Hollywood where he said instead of  making one $200 million movie try making  20 $10 million movies is someone whose  bread and butter was that mid-level  budget film do you at all resonate with  his frustrations in the way that the  business of Hollywood is changed over  the course of your career I absolutely  understand where he's coming from it  makes sense right you want to have the  best chance of having a strong Roi  people put a lot of money into these  things and they want to they want them  to be  profitable but I think if I look at the  industry as a whole this sort of big  push into superhero movies I mean you  can only make so  many good ones that feel truly original  and and yet there's still you know  always trying to reach as many people as  possible which sometimes hinders quality  or specificity or real point of view so  I I mean you're absolutely right I grew  up doing those movies and I sometimes  Lament The fact like I look back at some  of the movies that I made in the '90s  and think that just wouldn't get made  now I do think that you get more  diversity of art When there's less at  stake and people can sort of Express  their true voice and make a film the way  they want to make it and then I think  those are generally the more resonant  ones  [Music]  if I pass out will you CPR me or yeah  I'm you're in good hands you're in good  hands over here I got you  okay La what La La pment Tier mhm  forbidden  fruit wow  okay I know I took too big of a bite I  know I saw that [ __ ] a  that is such a JV move no it's not why  did I do that because you know you're  immersing yourself in the experience not  cheating The Experience over here right  what's a buster palro cocktail and can  you talk us through how to make one in  as much detail as possible Absolutely  I'll take notes okay a buster paltro is  a whiskey based cocktail inspired by my  grandfather Buster ptro who was a real  like he loved like a whiskey sour and a  bourbon sour that he ordered with no  fruit very important so basically what I  do it's 2 oz of your favorite Ry or  whiskey or whatever you like an ounz of  maple syrup and an oun of lemon juice  and you can shake it or stir it and  that's my go-to cocktail and what a  lovely pairing that would be right now  especially going into this neck  sauce I thought we were going to be  friends and  now right there's a lot give and I get  it I just don't know what's happening to  our trust right  now I'm so scared I'm literally shaking  my my wing is  shaking  [ __ ]  wow and then this be a kind of a unique  experience this is incredibly  painful but I will say despite the  discomfort this is one of the calmest  reactions I've ever seen to it in my  life  Wow right no I get it I get it right  here with you the the violation is  intense  right it's a good tagline  actually and on that topic is someone  who's been a prolific actor for over 30  years you know you have dozens upon  dozens upon dozens of movie credits you  know some of them Oscar winners other of  them box office mashes some of them you  might even have forgotten that you made  so to put that to the test I want to  play a little game where I'll hit you  with a Gwyneth paltro movie tag line and  I want you through the spice fog to try  to connect it to the Gwyneth palro movie  does that sound good I I have no idea  what you just said I don't speak English  I don't know what's happening I'm  talking to you underwater a little bit  right now I totally get how that goes  but how about this uh when good luck is  a long shot you have to hedge your  bets Hard Eight it is hard  eight there you go one for one how about  this one life was too small to contain  her shallow hell no that's a good guess  though wait that was a [ __ ] up guess  yeah I know was funny Sylvia one for two  how about this one it's better to be a  fake somebody than a real  nobody Talented Mr Ripley bang bang had  that one no problem um nothing spreads  like fear contagion there you go you're  on a roll it doesn't matter where you've  been as long as you come back strong  Country Strong oh my gosh I don't I  don't know if I'll be able to stop you  there are two sides to every  story sliding door this is incredible  you are on a roll um I got one more for  you okay rock and romance explode in a  Texas town oh I just not flash wait  shout yes shout I got it what do you  remember about shout do you remember  anything shout  1991 I was a kid  and I have to say I'm so impressed with  what you just did right there you know  your uh your credits they just endlessly  scroll you know what I mean but you were  able to just kind of pick those taglines  I think even through the the The Fog of  War of hot ones over here I think the  chili sort of Consolidated all my blood  and brain cells like here so my  cognition went  up  I I might throw  [Music]  up  right now remember the last one  immediately  jarring immediately breaking containment  yeah this one this is bad not fun either  but not like the last one not like the  last one  finding that calm Place wow so last fall  you did an interview with vog sat in the  stunning Garden of your amance at home  do you have a favorite herb at the  moment I really did not think you were  going to ask that that was so  funny  um I love all herbs except for dill  which should be illegal oh why should  Dill illegal cuz it's so  gross it ruins everything and anything  it touches with it's it's a dominant  kind of flavor dominant and like just  bad I don't understand why people like  it I I'm I love cilantro and I know some  people have that reaction to  cilantro but I love herbs I love I know  it's boring but basil is my

wings and  today we're joined by Harry Kane he's a  premier league Golden Boot award-winning  Striker for Tottenham one of the most  prolific goal scorers of all time and  the captain of England's national team  but Holly fare today in a  pressure-packed high-stakes match  against the wings of death I guess only  time will tell Harry Kane welcome to the  show thanks for having me thanks for  having me how are you around spicy food  before we get started yeah I'm not I'm  not great it's not something I normally  normally have a lot so I'm interested to  see how we get on today were you ready  to get started let's do it let's do it  [Music]  over here yeah  [Music]  okay okay  so far not too bad there we go yeah  [Music]  I was expecting a little bit worse I  think I was like  okay take your wins where you can get  them here it's actually quite nice there  you go maybe you were a hot sauce person  maybe I've just been missing out you  know what I mean  um that's not too bad I'm all right so I  want to congratulate you on another  record-breaking season scoring 30 plus  Premier League goals for the second time  in your career and then taking over  Wayne Rooney to become England's  all-time leading scorer every season has  its own meaning its own lessons how will  you remember this season and the Arc of  your career yeah this one uh you know  from a from a personal point of view has  been pretty special  um to break the the England all-time  goal scorer record was uh just a dream  come true really  um  we have so many amazing players that I  watched growing up  so many strikes  so many strikes and scoring goals  um it's nice to be at the top of that  list now so truly special and yeah for  another another 30 goal season which is  great  um so yeah overall you know I feel like  I'm improving I'm getting better even  though I'm uh a little bit older now so  I'm excited for for what's to come  a little bit of milk  it's happening yeah just a little a  little tingle on the on the front there  [Music]  okay let's do it yeah  [Music]  I found that one a little easier  great did you there's a little lever  pulling that happens you know that's  like uh I feel like the first one was a  little bit of a like a a little kick and  then this one's just not too bad you  know it's like a game you know you  settle into the game when you when you  get that first contest you know what I'm  saying that's what happened you got your  first hit now you don't feel like the  curry I I do like a curry back back home  in England so so it's kind of familiar  yeah I think there's a yeah I'm quite  familiar with that taste so  so as an American it's wild to read  about these European youth football  academies where you know at such a young  age the next messy the next Ronaldo the  next Kane is Anointed at at what age do  you think Talent can actually be  observed and then what's the first  memory you have of yours being  recognized in a meaningful way yeah  that's a great question you know uh like  someone like me I've been at the club  I'm at now since I was 11 years old yeah  so that's almost that's 18 years I've  been there and uh I think that's too  early to really tell  um you know if a player is going to be a  great player or not I think yeah that 15  16 Mark was when I started seeing like a  difference in me and you know my  confidence started growing and you know  people started looking at me maybe in a  bit of a different light and it's like  okay this this coup could have a future  so  um yeah when I went on talking to you  know parents or you know with young kids  who want to play football I'm just  telling them that up until kind of 14 15  just let them enjoy it let them kind of  uh feel their way into it because the  most important thing is that they're  happy right they want to right they want  to be enjoying what they're doing uh and  then once you kind of see physically how  they are at 1560 and that's when you get  to know what they're what they're gonna  be like then it's rather remarkable that  you and David Beckham came out of the  Ridgeway Rovers that's right yeah what's  special about that Youth Academy yeah  I'm not too sure that was our local so  me and David were both from a place  called chingford uh in East London and  um yeah we kind of both ended up at this  team obviously he was 10 or so years uh  before me maybe uh and yeah they just  had a good setup you know they had good  coaches there they had a good  environment you know when I went there I  just went there to enjoy it play  football with friends and uh that was  kind of the start for me so it brings  back some good memories there we go I  love that walk down memory later you're  ready to move on here I'm ready to Wing  number three  got a zesty lemon pepper okay waiting  here from the Crabby Shack  yeah  a little uh little kick to it yeah right  yeah a bit more than number two I think  and that's how it's kind of gonna go  from here that's me being honest with  you Harry I'm transparent you know it's  just like real easy just getting into it  yeah add a little uh yeah a little trail  that at least  seven more to go the little bit worrying  so but you know what you're somebody who  can conquer the mental all right you  want to be where you were now if it  wasn't for that I didn't see it in your  eyes right now seven more reps seven  more reps let's do it  so you and teammate young man's son have  set all kinds of Premiership records for  Combined goals is there anything that  you can point to that makes your  partnership so telepathic you know the  first kind of three four years we didn't  have that amazing record that we have  now it took us time to build that uh I  think getting to know  obviously how each other play on the  pitch but also what you like off the  pitch as well and we started to become  closer in Friendship we started to know  each other a little bit better and then  yeah I've just been come with you know  understanding each other's games you  know he's a fantastic player a lot of  skill and now kind of whenever I'm on  the ball he knows there's runs to make  him without thinking looking or playing  it straight away and uh yeah we've just  been both of us have I think just  improved along that along that process  and become a bit more prolific so uh  yeah he's a great player but a really  great guy as well do you have a personal  favorite goal of yours in your career  and if so can you paint the picture for  us  I think my favorite goal um  was my England debut goal um it was at  Wembley our home stadium I come on for  Wayne Rooney who was someone you know I  looked up to growing up that moment and  he's running off the pitch I'm running  on and I was just so excited and then  within I think it was about two about  three minutes of the game uh I scored my  first goal you know it was like a ball  kind of flowing over to the back post I  headed it down into the goal and just  that emotion in that moment was just you  know something that's hard to describe  it was just I had all my family there in  the stadium at my friends my wife Kate  and uh yeah just to kind of share that  moment as an England player and you know  no one can ever take that away from me  you know I still remember it so vividly  now so that's that's probably one that  always saves my favorite because it  meant so much  [Music]  pleasantly surprised but I feel like  this is just a real slow warm up into  what's to come smart man  [Music]  and this is kind of  one that takes a little bit of a jump  here or starts off kind of nice  kind of sweet approachable yeah  ah  yeah  it's got like a little um  little sweet barbecue situation but just  yeah it's just like there it's just like  there's a sharpness  exactly yeah  so I'm fascinated by your dream to one  day be a field goal kicker in the NFL  and I'm a Chicago Bears fan okay okay  and a few years ago we lost a playoff  game on what was famously called the  double doink okay it was a kick that  went off the upright and then off the  crossbar doinking rather loudly along  the way and then out to lose the game  and it's crystallized In My Memory like  one of my most crystallized sports fan  memories and I'm curious if you would  all sympathize empathize think about the  plight of the field goal kicker a  position that naturally lends itself to  being defined by its biggest failures  and lowest moments yeah that's that's  the that's the thing with the field okay  you know they're not probably the most  famous player on the team and not the  one maybe they get famous when they mess  up exactly so you know but they're  probably maybe other than the  quarterback under the most pressure when  they're on the pitch because you know  it's how many NFL games go down to a  winning field goal right and you win or  lose on the field goal so in terms of  pressure you know there's not many kind  of specific moments in sport like a NFL  kicker so I think that's why it's so  tough and like you said if you if you  miss one people remember that forever so  uh you've got to be pretty good to you  know stay good in those moments maybe  that's what makes it fun for you have  you ever thought about that maybe but it  depends if I if I make them or don't  maybe that's the risk maybe that's the  feeling yeah  you know it's very you know you'll have  the moment to be the hero but also you  have the moment to be the villain so is  that you know is that real balance but I  think that's what inside drives you know  athletes or the top competitors  to push them push themselves to those  sort of limits so we'll see we'll see  I'm ready so this next one is the Los  Calientes Rojo here  [Music]  so last year you posted that your New  Year's resolution for the past decade  has been to improve what are the  greatest lengths that you've gone to in  order to master a part of the game you  know I did read about you training with  only your left foot for three months  once yeah that left foot when I was  I think that was about 7 17 that time  maybe 18 and uh that I could use my left  foot I was good with my left foot but I  looked around I looked at the top  players and I thought well if I want to  be you know the best I need to be able  to pretty much score in my left foot as  simple as the right part of my left foot  and uh I said look I'm just gonna  [Laughter]  I'm just gonna use this uh I'm gonna use  this time to uh just practice my lift so  in training I lit uh literally every  shot I hit was with my left every time I  touched the ball I'll dribble with my  left passing my left foot got to the  stage where wherever I had a finish on  my right my left I felt natural on both  and uh yeah stuff like that is really  kind of excelled me and I feel like  separated me from you know some of the  other players who were probably just  says uh talented as I was at that age  um but that kind of mindset helped me to  get where I am now  [Music]  spicy shark is there a bike  it indeed does  [Music]  yeah for sure yeah  [Music]  in the bottom  and see that there's the spice just  sitting there just  taunting you  okay A bit already a bit of a nose it's  all gonna loosen up here  what's that time  are you at all envious of how American  sports stars position themselves in the  Press like have you observed a  difference between the British and  American media in terms of how they  treat athletes uh yeah I think so I  think  um you know I'd probably say American  athletes are a bit more open and a bit  more  um  maybe just say less guarded in their  approach interest how they talk in the  media  um maybe over in England you have to be  a little bit more careful with what you  say and how you say things I feel like  you know the public event ain't sitting  there knowing someone's kind of guarding  against certain questions or they don't  want to be have to say the only science  and they say maybe the correct answer if  you wanna but um yeah sometimes you want  to just say the truth yeah yeah pretty  much yeah pretty much but uh obviously I  understand how it works and you know  sometimes you just you can't do that but  um I definitely feel like over over here  in the States you can uh you know the  athletes are a little more open to doing  that  [Music]  it's still got a spicy shark on my  tongue so I know  [Music]  [Music]  yeah yeah yeah  super similar to The Spicy shark right  we're just like a massive jump I feel  like this the shark is a very spicy  number six for this lineup so it can be  kind of jarring you know you're like  this is how we're starting the second  half we got four more to go so it's kind  of nice the thing about  Chico over here is it kind of kicks in a  little bit later you know like as I  think that you're catching yeah  reflecting back on your career from the  youth game to now what's the most  memorable trick play or elaborate set  piece you ever recall participating in  oh good question so  um there was one for England we had we  was playing Panama in the World Cup in  2018 and uh we had like two guys on the  ball about 40 yards out they played a  like a pass to the right side to the  left side we were at all our position  you know what I think about now we all  had our set positions he kind of crossed  it over to me on the far side and then I  headed it back across goal to one of my  teammates and and it worked we literally  we worked on it and training the day  before the game and you know sometimes  you work on this stuff and it's like you  know you never you'll get to the game  and it never works you know people are  in different positions  but this one just worked perfectly and  we ended up scoring from it so that's  one that you know I always remember  I've heard about this uh the bomb the  bomb Beyond insanity  what have you heard  I've just heard it's brutal and  unenjoyable  well I guess we'll find out we will  [Music]  that's not nice no not at all that's not  nice  [Music]  [Applause]  not the others  I feel like you could have with a nice  bit of food or whatever right even when  they were spicy you saw some sort of  redeeming culinary quality not in this  one though  [Music]  I just  I just burned everything in your mouth I  know I know and then here we are on an  interview show and I'm about to ask you  a question right right  now it is getting off  what in your mind is the greatest  football Anthem or chant of all time  well  Tottenham have a good one for me  they assume he's one of our own which  come about  I scored a  that's called a hat trick in a one of my  first games  um it was a Europa League game at the  time  and uh  I just started hearing him seeing he's  one of our own he's one of he's one of  our own and uh yeah it was just because  I've come through the academy because  I've been Hometown Hometown hero that  was it it was kind of uh yeah their way  of kind of singing a song for me and uh  it really like Hit me hard it was  amazing to hear and uh yeah I was local  to the stadium that's pretty rare in our  sport to have that so yeah to have them  sing he's one of our own you know feels  like I'm I'm part of them I'm part of  the fan group and that's pretty special  in the way that you just took the bomb  to the chest I think you're man of the  people Legacy is only going to grow from  here I think so I hope so after after  doing it I'm doing this for everyone  right now  wow that is like a  it's crazy it's intense always a part of  the show where you don't know where it's  gonna go because that has to be the  spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your  life out and the most probably the most  disgusting as well there's no way anyone  would ever eat that  to have life an enjoyable meal there's  nowhere  there's two more to go as well by the  way right  for better or worse this next one is the  watermelon ghost  I feel like my mouth caught me anymore  right it's scorched Earth  how bad can it be  [Music]  I feel like I can't feel anything  yeah I feel like my mouth is just  completely uh  the hard work is over here Harry the  hard work is all over you know once you  get through the bomb you can take on  anything yeah I feel like but again that  was like  [Music]  find something you like  the the bomb one is just at the space of  a source  do you have any sort of strategy or  Rules of Engagement when it comes to  working the Reps during a match or is  that kind of communication just purely  visceral yeah is impossible to spool you  know you have to be able to  try and uh help get help in any way  possible and you know sometimes if  you're come just shouting at the ref all  the time or you know he's going to maybe  take that the other way and almost you  know just put you to one side give you  no decisions or whatever it may be you  know the ref is always  yeah to you know do his job but he's a  he's a human at the end of the day so  um you know I'm someone who likes to  talk to the refs and try and understand  some of the decisions they've made  because I know and they're not always  going to be perfect  yeah ultimately it's just about you know  figuring out what type of ref you got  and then trying to like  um  psychology and see what works for you  yeah in any given situation yeah  all right oh  we had a bit actually  [Music]  how much we talking  what was that is that good yeah that's  actually that's perfect that's perfect  right Cheers Cheers  going in  I love it  I love it  wow yeah  another crazy one but I know I know but  it's all over straight out my nose  pretty much it's all over you did it the  worst is behind you and just one more  question to close things out you know I  came into this experience with a new  greater appreciation for the sport and  for you Harry Kane forever a Harry Kane  supporter on this side of the table but  over the course of the research there's  so much just strange lingo things that I  needed definitions for and I think now  is the perfect time to bounce some of  those things off of you to see if you  can Define these things while your brain  slow roasts and hot sauce okay yeah  let's do it what's a fox in the Box  fox in the box is like a just a shop you  know like nippy kind of player  scores the goals but don't do much else  if there's a fox in the Box they just  score goals close by a few tap-ins yeah  what's a dead ball specialist Deadpool  Deadpool specialist is um  that's a you know like a free kit yeah  or a corner kick yeah and they just  they're like top of their game in that  so they'll score loads of free kicks in  their corner corner kicks and stuff are  always just perfectly in the Box  um so yeah that's a Deadpool what's a  howler  a howler is like a real bad mistake  so so uh  if you're like a goalkeeper and you that  one for your legs or one you're supposed  to catch that's the house yeah yeah well

      "page_content": "yo yo what's up GQ it's Moses the  Jeweler and I'm back to break down some  crazy celebrity  [Music]  watches we have Bad Bunny wearing a  white gold automar Paget 39 mm this is  with the chronograph and old factory  jump set diamonds I know Drake has one  of these in his collection too so I'm  sporting this one time very rare very  different as you see in the sub dials  also you have three different colors of  pearl the way the light hits it if you  see the watch in person which I have  seen it it's gorgeous retail I would  have to assume probably around like 140  150,000 I do notice a discontinued piece  the secondary Market you're paying well  over 200 to flood out this whole thing  and make it look like this they used to  do it a lot for the ladies now it became  really popular with the men men want to  bling you know what I'm saying same  thing with the hip-hop jewelry back in  the '90s most people wearing the plain  gold now everyone diamonds diamonds  diamonds they want to be flooded  out over here we have Travis Scott  wearing something crazy this is a 5719  this is done in white gold as I said  before padic Philip they're setting  diamonds they're using the best quality  the highest quality if for a rapper of  this caliber he wants a factory so here  he's rocking that on stage it's a  superstar piece this one will run you  around  $750,000 it's a crazy bezel and I love  the contrast between the round cut  diamonds and the baguette Cuts in the  center it's like again such different  shine different pop from every area it's  like they did an incredible job with  this one it's a light show it's a light  show I've seen this one in person I was  going to pull out my credit card keep it  for myself but it's going to run me too  much but the way that this thing shines  you're going to need sunglasses it's  crazy right here we got a maluma rocking  a automar pag Royal o skeleton one of my  dream pieces this is a reference 15412  BC so over here you have like three of  the best things in the world we got here  the open work which of course AP is  famously known for we got the rainbow  bezel which AP Cho is the finest quality  gems for their rainbow bezel and then we  got the Florentine finish as they like  to say the Frosted finish on the band  and the amount of work and time that  goes into creating a piece like this  incredible and AP does it best and this  is why a piece like this is going to  cost you over half a million dollars for  your  collection since retirement Tom Brady's  been going crazy this padic pH it goes  for a retail price of $108,000 and on  the secondary Market they're looking at  closer to $250,000 range right now this  is an incredible piece an incredibly  rare piece and a piece that has a big  demand at the top of its Market seeing  them even close to 400,000 this is a  Daytona reference 6241 in solid yellow  gold and something very rare over here  is you actually see this Daytona in a  jubilee band which you don't see I wish  Rolex were to bring it back this is an  extremely iconic piece classic piece  that this definitely call it him a  pretty penny if I'd have to assume I'd  say something like this is like half a  million dollars on the market Daytona  became popular once Paul Newman sported  it back in like the late 60s early 70s  this Daytona is the iconic look this is  the one that made all these daytonas hot  and going for a crazy special premium  it's recognizable right away because of  its dial you have three sub dials in the  center and whenever you see the Rolex  silhouette with that dial automatic  Daytona right here we got Tom Brady  wearing probably the most controversial  piece of the Year this is the Rolex Day  Day 36 mm with the puzzle dial so it's  funny with the day and date you have a  function I'll take off my watch to show  the people with the day date you have  the function in order to read the day  and the date on its dial and on this  piece Rolex first of all they switched  out the day and the date for emojis as  the date function and for the day they  had different sayings like love and so  on a lot of people said that Rolex went  off of their classic look when they  created this and some people were  against it me personally I love it it  kind of shows no limits in this world it  kind of shows that the you you got to  push the boundary you know it was for a  good cause it was for children with  autism so they wenter really colorful  with this I'm a big fan of this one  super limited it was an off catalog  piece I do believe the retail was around  58,000 for this they were fetching a  high retail for it resil is going to be  crazy so over here you got the date  window and the day window which makes it  a date date of  course over here we got Ed Shar and  we're on a crazy AP Royal Oak concept  Spider-Man this is an AP concept uh  silhouette which has a different  silhouette than your average AP which  has that octagonal shape this one has a  little more curvature and this one is  actually done in Titanium with a black  ceramic bezel and a black ceramic Crown  Marvel actually collaborated with ap in  order to create two different versions  they created a black Panther and over  here you have the Spider-Man which is uh  we call this big boy toys it's not your  Spider-Man that came in a Happy Meal as  we say this is one that uh costs at  around uh  $215,000 price range that all the money  did go for a charity something like this  especially when it's numbered in crazy  high demand minimal two times over the  retail value which is 215 so something  like this could set you back at least  half a million and then a really up  Market some people even pay up to a  million dollars for a piece like this so  over here we have John Mayor and Ed  Sheran wearing the same same watches on  stage together which makes them around  the 1% of the collectors in the world  when you have 250 pieces two of them are  right next to each other which is pretty  awesome to see and of course big shout  out to John Mayer crazy collector cheer  and had to show him that he can go  head-to-head with  him we have John Mayor wearing a Royal  Oak in yellow gold this one's actually a  37 mm so reference 15550 ba I'm a little  jealous looking at this one this is a  piece that I actually wanted to add to  my own collection I'm still looking for  it the special thing about this watch is  the dial it's Insanity so turquoise dial  is actually cut from a specific  turquoise stone so no dial is going to  be the same you have different veins and  different marble in every single one  which makes every single piece extremely  unique this is why AP makes such a  limited amount cuz they're very hard to  make something like this right now in  the secondary Market people probably pay  upward of like 170  80,000 when you're buying a watch like  this you're also buying into the company  of AP itself and you're buying their  best stock basically so when you have a  watch like this and you believe in AP  then uh something like this will only go  up in value I see it doubling to even  tripling in value in the next 5 to 10  years here we have Steve Harvey rock in  a rose gold RM 6501 I love that rose  gold and an RM is Sleek it's clean every  time you look deep into it you find  something else and something else and  something else and it's like this is  what makes Richard Mill Richard  Mill we got messy Rock in here Paddock  phip krava when you hear krava you think  very classic old man but uh we see him  rocking it on a nice sporty uh band  which kind of gives it that modern look  you have the baby blue hand with the  baby blue sshing classic clean piece and  something that is not going to break  your bank if you want to go into Paddock  the retail on this piece was around  35,000 and on the secondary Market  you're going to probably pay around 45  to 48,000 so you're not paying a crazy  premium to own a nice Paddock FIP that  you even see stars like lonel Messi  rocking light piece as he said let me  throw my white t-shirt and my $50,000  Paddock right over here we got Jacob  Alli wearing a very clean black suit  looks like he's at a red carpet event he  went with a cardier tank normal and 18  karat yellow gold went with a very  classic piece smaller face but um  sometimes big doesn't mean special  sometimes small means special also so  I'm like this it shouldn't break the  bank between 8 and 15,000 range  depending on condition and year and  stuff like that it's something not so  hard to get but also you're not going to  see every watch collector have this in  their collection if you don't want to be  so showy you're going to rock something  like this something that has a statement  of course cuz the gold but not big not  loud and then the black leather of  course kind of makes it more  subdued  AP Royal Oak 41 mm this one he's rocking  with the chronograph so you have two  different options you have the Chrono  and the non- Chrono Chrono is going to  cost you a little bit extra dollars  because of the functionality again  classic piece clean Sleek Rich dress it  up dress it down talks for itself this  is basically same mod that we do see  culu rocking but this one is in a 39 mm  K size same silhouette but of course a  different look in the center of the dial  this was a little more busy as we  say over here we got Chris Paul rocking  a yellow gold Vashon 222 I love those  numbers it's good luck he's sporting  your next to nice van CLE which I also  like me as a jeweler that's where my eye  goes to again very classic look Vashon  is also one of the best of what they do  different style different look Chris  Paul said everyone's rocking the Roes  and the aps let me throw on a nice  yellow gold vason stand out a little be  a little different it's a different band  you know every watch is famous for the  band that they do just like when we have  AP and you see this band you  automatically know AP when you see sound  like this and you see this band you  automatically think presidential day day  so over here vason did their own style  their own take on it if it catches as  good as this the price will definitely  go up got Brad Pit rocking the same bat  around over here I think he saw Chris  Paul rocking it he said you know what I  want one also that's the influence that  the celebrities have you know you see  one rocket they could change the market  for any for any watch at any  time over here we got ice spice rocking  a rm5 some diamonds on it I like the  combo she has over here we got the white  strap with the solid rolls gold then you  got those white diamonds hidden it looks  to me like it is a custom job on the RM  looks like the diamonds were added after  this isn't Factory Diamond set but uh  still a gorgeous job the diamonds are  shining this is almost like the uh the  starter RM they call it this one is not  the one that's going to break the bank  and cost you many hundred thousands this  one you're probably going to be paying  around 100,000 to 150,000 this is the  rm05 it's like the starter piece to get  in which will run you close to six  figures if you're looking to buy a watch  that's covered in diamonds I would buy a  factory if you're looking to hold its  value this is something that the company  stands behind you can always go and get  your watch service by Rolex AP if they  did set the diamonds this is something  that's very rare very hard to come  across and everyone knows the rules of  supply and demand the demand gets bigger  the supply becomes smaller price goes up  thank you guys thank you GQ for having  me I'll see you guys next  time",

      "page_content": "so how many tattoos do you think you  have now uh I see it as one tattoo so I  I wouldn't be able to count yeah people  always say I look like a melted  [Music]  crayon I grew up in a household my  parents they worked in art and I was  surrounded by colorful paintings my mom  painted our bedroom like bright colors  and I was surrounded by creative bright  colored things and when I first started  getting tattoos I was just like I like  color my first one was uh this little  pow print Christina Perry it was in her  brother's tattoo shop and I had no idea  we actually ended up making music  together and touring together in the  future but it was in her brother's  tattoo shop in 2010 I just turned 18 and  I I was legal to get a tattoo so I  walked into this shop I've drawn this  por print on me for about 3 or four  years every day with permanent marker  and I was like that's going to be my one  tattoo and I'll get no more obviously  that didn't last  actually I got these with Christina  Perry I was just about to play Madison  Square Garden for three times I was told  by my dad like if you can make it in New  York you can make it anywhere in the  world and it's quite a significant thing  for me to come here and play three  nights my grandfather was a boxer and  worked in boxing as well and Madison  Square Garden is sort of synonymous with  boxing so that's why I got three boxing  gloves my grandfather had also just  passed away so it's kind of part and  parcel of that  this was 2012 October I featured on  Taylor's album Red I got it to signify  that it was actually before I think I I  hadn't been asked to be on the red tour  at that point maybe this clinched it and  then I went on the Red Tour and that was  a year of my life living in America so  it's quite a like significant tattoo of  like that time how what did she think of  about the  tattoo I kind of remember actually I  imagine at the time being like why why  are you doing  that my my favorite tattoo my daughter  drew a little bunny rabbit and I got  that tattooed so that's probably my  favorite one at the moment just because  it's always covered up no one else sees  it but it's something that I look at  every day I've got my kids footprints on  my back when they were born we got their  Footprints and I put them in little  squares after going to Antarctica which  is possibly the most amazing place on  the planet like it's really blw my mind  seeing the orcus for the first time time  when they come out of the water it's  like really breathtaking also like when  you're going into Antarctica you see the  first penguin and you're like oh my God  and then by the end of it you you're  just like penguins they're just  everywhere it's just like oh it's  another [ __ ] penguin but that is what  my daughter is named  after I mean they're all kind of  meaningful but in terms of like most  meaningful I'd say like this little  number one finger for my friend Michael  who passed away and then this little  sptv for my friend Jamal that passed  away and I wanted to have have them on  my guitar playing hand just so they're  always like there cuz they've both been  involved in my career in quite big  ways I met Damen rice when I was like  super young I'd gone to like an under 18  show with my cousin in uh Dublin I met  him afterwards in the bar he was just  there having a point and I went up and  spoke to him and it was before I'd  started writing songs or really taking  that seriously and it was that was like  the turning point of my life really have  you seen the album cover for o anyway  it's like two little stick drawings and  then it says Damen rice over the two  little stick drawings and he took my  album and signed it and then drew a  little stick drawing of me with a plane  above me cuz I'd flown over with my dad  to irand that's essentially stick  drawing me with the plane kind of where  my career started  essentially something I wanted to get  for a while was the lyrics everything  that happens is from now on from reacks  I'd spoken to Gary lightbody from Snow  Patrol about it and we were both like  that's our favorite lyric we should get  that tattooed and I was like if I ever  meet him I'll get to write it in his  handwriting he was playing in suffk  which is where I live and I managed to  get to meet him and so I got it in  handwriting I got a tattooed and Gary  decided that he didn't want to get it  done but Gary doesn't have any tattoos  either I think I'm a bit more free with  skin I also heard you have a matching  tattoo with per Styles yeah I think he's  tattooed over his it wasn't so much  matching I got the little Pingu penguin  and he got Pingu written but I think  he's covered it with a an anchor which  obviously looks a bit  [Music]  cooler I was doing the video for goway  girl with s shiron and she tattoos me in  the video and I said to her it be funny  if we misspell it goway  Grill I think I said in an interview  that she'd spelled it wrong and then  that went round that she' spelled it  wrong but we had we had planned it sersa  did actually tattoo me I don't think  she's given a tattoo since I think this  is the soul CER  tattoo I'm a big fan of the TV show The  Fresh prin of Bel Air and I was making  this sleeve and getting tattoos and  significant places that I was traveling  so I got you know the hind ketchup in  Pittsburgh and the koala in Australia I  was like what do I get for Philly and I  got  Prince I was on tour with brickton  they're Four Lads and we were on tour  and in Great Britain there's like a  phrase of when you're going out drinking  with the lads your Lads on tour and I  was like oh we're Lads on tour we should  get Lads on tour tattooed yeah it's  about as basic as it can be but  yeah I was playing Wembley Stadium  wembly stadium is the biggest stadium  that we have in the UK I didn't know I  would be playing a stadium ever I didn't  even think I'd be playing Arenas I  thought I was a a theater artist and I  sold out three Wembley in 2015 For the  First Time The Wembley is the home of  English football the crest of English  football is Three Lions so I wanted to  get something connected with that I  still think it's the biggest achievement  of my life playing Wembley  Stadium so I got plus multiply divide  and subtract tattooed around my wrist I  had the plan of the mathematics from  like 2010 in my head that was the plan  of the albums that I was going to do  plus multiply divide and subtract equals  came in in there a bit later but the  next symbols have been on my arm for 13  years as well and I start that series  next year I guess that's kind of Prison  Break of me isn't it just Clues most  painful tattoo by far was s  familiar 8 hours of just like you know  the they do the tattoo needle with like  20 needles and it's just scraping in it  was Grim like  Grim I think tatos hurt more the more  you get like your first one I remember  getting this and being like oh that  wasn't that bad and I feel the older I'm  getting maybe it's just cuz I'm getting  older but someone said it's the more you  get tattoos your body is saying please  stop doing this and the more you get it  the more it's saying please please just  [ __ ] stop doing this",

      "page_content": "Hey GQ, I'm Ben Affleck and I'm going to  answer a question about almost every  movie I've  done. That was too loud.  Goodwill Hunting. How did you and Matt  get into the mind of a genius? Well, as  far as I know, neither Matt nor I are  geniuses. So, getting into the mind of a  genius wasn't going to literally be or  even metaphorically be possible. But I  mean, the idea of a character who has  special abilities is very appealing. I  think it's at the root of the wish  fulfillment stuff in Marvel. I mean, if  you just think of any superhero, right?  It's like, I seem like an everyday  ordinary high school kid or he's  getting, you know, thrown against the  locker, but actually I'm Spider-Man.  Part of the trick is to not have to show  the whole thing, but to sort of hint at  it, you know, the discovery of him  solving the theorem. I mean, obviously,  you know, Matt and I uh could no more do  multivariable calculus than we could the  kind of math that you we couldn't even  name the math that that he was doing,  you know, matrix multiplication or  whatever in the hallways of MIT. So, we  knew there was a sort of okay, we're  going to have to get some expert to fill  this in. But the idea that it was that  it would come from an unexpected person  as Stellin's character is like, who did  this? he's asking his class that they  never uh would expect that this guy  who's working there cleaning the  building was special. I think had some  appeal to us probably for me because my  father had that job at at Harvard was a  janitor. I think at the time uh I like a  lot of young people and maybe even older  people really wanted to have my dad to  be a hero and I think I took some of  that and into that sort of idea but we  really just you know faked it and we and  when we had to have like you know  elaborate sophisticated mathematical  solutions you know we had call on people  who could do that. We heard that on Star  Trek when they were going to write their  sci-fi stuff the writers would just say  tech tech. So we did it and then people  were like I'm sorry what is the tech? We  were like oh we thought that was a thing  that's how that's not how you do it in  the show business and they were like no  no one does that and then you know like  we had mathematicians at MIT who kind of  and by the way they could have been  totally making it up. You know what I  mean? We went we looked at it like yeah  that looks good like yeah okay guys you  got Batman vs. Superman Dawn of Justice.  Do you have any regrets? Uh no I had a  great time. I love being in Detroit. I  really love Zach. Chris Terry was a  writer who I love and I really liked the  core notion of this superhero who you  know has this very iconic kind of  legendary you know image in the public  consciousness and who people kind of  thought of a c one kind of way which was  very strong and very powerful and all  this stuff and trying to find the  reality in that which was a guy who's  kind of aging and past that prime and  has to like aches has aches and pains  and very much inspired by the Frank  Miller graphic novel A Dark Knight where  Superman and Batman you know are in  conflict and I love doing it and love  making it and uh I guess my regret about  that movie is that when I went to show  it to my son at the times I thought okay  this is it was totally too scared to  watch it so I lost out on that thing of  like kind of being Batman to my son now  he's like old enough he's You were  Batman right at one point a long time.  I'm like just don't worry about it.  Dazed and confused. Was this anything  like your high school experience? The  experience like that movie was very  similar to my school in some ways. Kind  of high school drama. You know, you have  all these kids who are trying to figure  out who they are and what they're going  to do with their life. And so everything  feels like very big and momentous. And  it, you know, it's they're not wrong in  a way. When I think back of high school,  those four years, it seems like a much  bigger period of life than say like some  other arbitrary four years in my 30s or  40s, that still feels kind of like when  your identity is formed. And I think  that's what Rick touched on and grabbed.  And he also just wanted to make it real  and consistent with his experience. I  learned one of the most important  lessons I've ever learned on that movie,  which is that he really welcomed and  solicited input and partnership on all  the actors to come up with ideas and  write lines and and then he made the  movie the movie evolved with that. And  it I didn't know you could do that. Uh  and I wasn't even able to try to do it  until much later. But I remembered the  how exhilarating it was even the movie  bombed. It was a disaster of a movie  commercially like you know it was sort  of like oh that's I remember reading in  something that was like oh how  embarrassing you know but I liked it and  I'm I'm really glad that it you know  attained the kind of sort of I guess  cold status that it has. Gone  Girl who is the real villain here.  I don't know if there is a specific  villain in Gone Girl. I think that's one  of the things that makes it interesting  is that you keep changing your  estimation of these characters as the  movie goes along and reveals more to you  and as it gets both darker and even a  little bit more, you know, almost  absurdest in a way. David Fincher, who I  love and adore, one of the things that  he's really good at is understanding the  way that movies work. I mean, such a  sort of masterful director. He  understands what the expectations are of  a movie like that, what the tropes are,  what we're all used to, and then  confounding those and subverting them so  that as you point out, oh, this person's  not necessarily who they would be in  every other movie or and so who we kind  of subconsciously expect them to be. And  obviously Gillian, you know, wrote a  very a terrific book that that I had a  huge success because I think it engaged  people and it and she touched on uh I I  think in a lot of ways some of the like  frustrating contradictory expectations  for relationships and and women in  particular. You know, the sort of cool  girl monologue people have, you know,  talked about a lot and I had the sense  that that really resonated with with  women. And David kind of has a dark  comic sensibility and so he kind of  played with the genre in fun ways and  then you know like became like this uh  very dark movie but it also never lost  its sense of fun. Buffy the Vampire  Slayer. Tell us what happened here. My  voice was removed from my performance.  I'm not sure that they meant for me to  have a line, so I may have been paid as  like a featured extra but I'm I know I  said a line and they recorded it. So,  I'd like to think it was some union  thing that they re-recorded my  performance, but maybe the director was  just like, \"This guy's so bad. We need  someone else to say take it.  [Applause]  Take it, man.\"  Armageddon. What was the coolest set  piece you got to play with? I got to  walk onto the space shuttle at Cape  Canaveral. Cape Kennedy. They let me go  into their, it's hardly even in the  movie, wear an actual space suit and go  into the they have this huge tank full  of water with a spa a life-siz space  shuttle built in there to try to  simulate weightlessness for like  repairing the shuttle and they're like  let us go in that thing uh you know  briefly you know that's a very rarified  experience and I was like surrounded by  all these astronauts and that's where I  started realizing like these people are  very highly skilled and trained and  We're doing a movie where it's easier  to, you know, train like oil drillers to  be astronauts than it is to train  astronauts to drill a hole in the  ground. But it was it was an incredible  opportunity. And I'm really lucky I got  a chance to be in some of those kind of  I think of as in a way oldfashioned  movies where you traveled around the  globe and went to real places cuz as  visual effects came along, you stopped  having to go to like now they just put  the space shuttle in behind you. We  actually filmed the space shuttle  takeoff. It was amazing. Jay and Silent  Bob strike back. Who wrote Goodwill  Hunting to Hunting Season?  Kevin came up with that idea. And  fortunately, that script is uh is only  as much has been written as as as is in  that movie. But that was all to Kevin's  credit. It was very funny, a very funny  idea. And that was a point where there  was so much of just like Goodwill  Hunting around us that we kind of wanted  to sort of, I don't know, take the wind  out of it or make fun of it or get away  from it. I think it's like the sort of  stupid solopistic ideas you have when  you know you're in that kind of  position. Phantoms. I was the bomb at  Phantoms. Everyone knows that. Peter  Tulle, by the way, Peter Tulle signed my  Lawrence for Arabia poster that's out  there on Phantom. Nikki Cat, Le Shriber.  I loved him in that movie. Well, no, I  didn't love him in the movie, but I like  those people. The movie was a sewer  monster movie, let's face it. And I was  a sheriff in Colorado. I was like 20  years old. It was totally absurd. And  the movie was utter garbage. But I did  get to ski. I made like $100,000. So I  was like, I'm set for life. I'm  retiring. And I met Peter Oul and like  got stoned with Peter Oul and like what  else happens in my life that tops this?  Nothing.  Jie, what did you learn? I learned to  kind of what I the the the basics of  directing and what I know about  directing from Marty Breast on that  movie. Marty had done Midnight Run and  Son of a Woman and Beverly Hills Cop and  Going in Style and Me Black and he was  wonderful and loving and I also learned  that you have to take big swings. One of  the most important movies of my career.  Had I not done that, I probably would  have lived too much in fear of failure.  The Town, what films influenced you? you  know, the town. I found it helpful to  look at other films when I'm going to  direct something, not to copy it or  steal it, although if I can steal  something, sometimes it's that's I'm  certainly not above it. I find it  helpful because it kind of lets me  communicate also to the other filmmakers  involved in making it, whether it's the  cinematographer, the actors, the gaffer,  whoever, and say, \"This is sort of what  I'm trying to do.\" For the town, he was  chief among them for obvious reasons. I  think there was also sort of a there's a  movie called The Friends of Eddie Coyle  that I thought was a really interesting  darker look at characters particularly  in Boston. You know, I had done a lot of  action sequences and uh sort of kinetic  stuff as an actor, but not as a  director. And so that was intimidating  and daunting. I had an idea about what I  wanted to do and a belief sort of that I  could do it, but to be honest, I was  quite scared. It was also a movie where  if that hadn't worked probably, you  know, it would have been the last movie  certainly that that you saw me as an  actor in. That was an authentically sort  of comeback time. There wasn't a huge  appetite demand for me to be in movies  or uh and I really kind of used  directing as a as a way to redefine  myself as an actor because I wanted to  do it on my own terms and according to  what my instincts were about it. And I  was willing to really fail in that  capacity if if that was the case. But I  at least wanted to do it on my own  terms. And I knew that in order to  connect get a larger audience and  connect people to the movie and provide  some kind of familiar guard rails in a  way that they people could get through  that movie. I wanted to combine those  genres of like the robbery, you know,  the chase uh with the drama. And in a  way that still informed my interest in  movies like The Accountant Too, which I  think is similar in a lot of ways. The  Accountant. How did you research playing  a neurode divergent character for the  first accountant movie? Uh I did do a  lot of of of traditional research in  terms of spending a lot of time in in  schools and around uh similarly neurody  divergent uh people old and young and  it's a role that I have a lot of  affection and fondness for that. I find  the character sort of a weird thing.  It's a very actor thing to say like I  like this character but it's true. I do  it's fun. There's a wit and a lovely  kind of dry uh wit that comes with um a  tendency to be very honest which I find  extremely appealing and charming and  quite vulnerable in a way when a person  kind of is willing to just lay bear the  truth rather than lay on a bunch of the  sort of masks that we put on in you know  polite society or whatever. The  accountant too. What made you excited to  come back to this story? The account was  something I was really really excited  about for a number of reasons. One, I  really loved the first movie and I loved  the experience of doing it and in the  years since then often people come up to  me and say I really liked you know that  movie and named the accountant. That  movie in particular had a really uh kind  of enthusiastic following like people  liked it. It it was like a I guess a  modest hit theatrically, but it really  benefited from the emergence of  streaming. So, I feel like a lot more  people saw it and I love the part and  the character. I thought like there was  an opportunity to lean into the warmth  and humanity of the character and  explore the brother's relationship. And  I'm personally very interested in  finding a way to make movies that, you  know, would be considered like very  commercial, very accessible, very broad,  and infusing those with uh the kind of  like humanity and and hopefully like  nuance and complexity and honesty that  we kind of associate with dramas, I  guess. Uh because that's what I'm  interested in. I I want to try to make  those movies broadly appealing.  Daredevil. Why' you want to do this  movie? I love the comic book and I I  loved working with Mike Duncan and Colin  and Jen Garner and uh it wasn't the  adaptation ultimately that like I  thought was the best version of what it  could have been. Uh and that was  disappointing.  The  Flash. Was this your favorite bat suit?  I mean, I hated the bat suits. The bat  suits are horrendous to wear. They're  incredibly hot for one thing. They don't  breathe. They're made to look the way  they want them to look. And there's no  thought put into the human being. And so  what happens is that you just start  sweating. Now I'm already I sweat. You  know what I mean? I get hot. And so in  that thing, it would just be pouring  water because it's got the cow over it.  Like there's one thing to wear the suit,  but once you cover your head, I guess  that's where all your heat kind of  escapes and you feel it. Even the like  most highly trained, you know, much more  fit stunt guys, the parkour guys, the  action guys, they could do that for  about like 4550 minutes and then they  are like going to get heat stroke. So  you had to come out of it. And that was  really the thing was that it's it just  made it difficult to make the movie  because it was so hot. It also does not  make you feel very heroic because you're  instantly exhausted and really sweaty  and kind of trying to hide like the  sweat pouring down your face. Like no,  we can go again. I'm fine. I'm good. And  the eye black is like running. Yeah, I  don't know. Maybe uh you know, Christian  or or Rob or or you know, guys like that  uh were just better at uh maybe you know  dealing with it, but I found it to be  the least fun part of it.  Argo, is it true that you would have  loved to have turned this into a  miniseries? Um it's not that I would  have loved to have made into a  miniseries. It's that if Argo were made  today, first of all, it would not be  released theatrically. I think the  conventional wisdom even at the time was  dramas, period dramas in particular,  particularly about like true life like  even political adjacent events do not  succeed theatrically. And now I'm sure  that that sense that that there wouldn't  even be any willingness to take a risk  on it. So what it would be would be  something more like um well like the  best example I can think was Chernobyl  on HBO. It was a spectacular limited  series that really delved into that  event, which I think is still one of the  best things I've seen in recent years.  It's amazing. And that would have  afforded more latitude to kind of look  at all of the various underpinnings and  complexities and pressures brought to  bear on all the relative parties. And  also maybe some more fun with the  Hollywood stuff and the notions of  fantasy and the universality of  storytelling and that kind of thing, you  know. And if I was going to explore more  about it, I I think I would explore a  lot more around how it is that we  arrived at a place in 1979 where the  embassy was overthrown. I tried to do  that, you know, in this very brief  credit sequence, but there's a lot more  there to examine that I think is  interesting.  He Why did it take so long for this  story to be told? I have no idea. It's a  great story. I think maybe Michael  Jordan needed to be kind of enshrined in  history in a way where there was a  little bit of distance. There's nobody  that more powerfully exemplifies  greatness than Michael Jordan. And in a  lot of ways, it's very similar  thematically. You know, when you think  about it just in terms of like somebody  spectacular, it's like a superhero story  really. It's an origin story, but it's a  real life genius story. It's a different  kind of genius, but it's a genius  nonetheless. As soon as I read it, I  thought like this is the story to tell.  Justice League. What makes the SN cut  special? Somebody sent me something that  showed me like the Snyder cut of the  Justice League was my highest rated  movie on IMDb, which I was like found  quite interesting. And I think it's  because one of the things the Snyder  cut, so to speak, is actually really the  movie that Zach wanted to make. you have  a director with a very clear idea of the  kind of story they understand and want  to tell and they know and then you've  got like a a commercial expectation like  for example like a very valuable like IP  property etc. And so there's so  sometimes they'll hire this person for  their distinctive take and view and then  we want to impose on that something  different and the tension between those  two things I think was very difficult  and and caused the movie the first movie  to feel very much like neither fish nor  foul which happens. What I was really  glad about was that Zach got the chance  to go back and make the movie that he  very much wanted to make. you know, a  lot of like long slow motion sequences  and stuff in black and white, very much  like R-rated. That's if you want to get  uh Zach to direct a movie, you should  make a Zach movie. One of the things  about directing is um typically you want  to have it be closest to what that  director is interested in and finds  appealing. And so that movie is very  much what Zach's vision was. And it's a  rare thing that somebody gets the chance  to go back and revisit and try to do  what they wanted to do. And given the  difficulty of that movie, I was very  happy for Zach that he got a chance to  do that. Gone, baby. Gone. Does Casey  take your direction? Well,  uh, Casey has very strong ideas about  how he wants to play scenes because he's  a great actor. To be fair, what I've  learned about directing is that you've  got to have a point of view and you've  got to lead, but you've also got to  listen. You've got this opportunity to  hear from a lot of other brilliant  people. And I truly believe it's a  collaborative experience. And in that  case, uh, Casey, you know, did amazing  stuff that I wouldn't have envisioned.  And I'm glad that, you know, that was a  collaborative experience. And to my  credit, I knew how good he was. I think  before other people did, although his he  was in the um, Assassination of Jesse  James by the coward Robert Ford right  before Gone Baby Gone came out and I  think he got nominated for that movie.  So, I didn't get to kind of tada with  with Casey, but nonetheless, you would  be unwise to work with any actor and not  have a two-way communication about how  it's going to be. And also, when  someone's your brother, they don't  respect you. So, you know, you can't  expect them to listen to you. Pearl  Harbor, did you initially turn it down?  I never definitely didn't turn it down.  They sent me the script. I sort of  thought about it. I went and met with  them, talked about it, and then  ultimately they really wanted to make  sort of uh Titanic, I guess. Certainly,  I mean, everyone wanted to make Titanic  in the sense that it was the biggest  movie ever made, but also sort of  tonally and thematically didn't quite  end up being that. It sort of ended up  being Armageddon in the Second World  War, but it was a hell of a lot of fun  and an honor to do because I spent a lot  of time with Medal of Honor winners. I  got to do a boot camp with like real US  Army soldiers like pre-ranger training  camp and it and it was probably the most  fascinating and moving personal  experience to be on all these aircraft  carriers and working alongside so many  men and women in the military and just  to get to travel and to do a movie of  that of that scale was was pretty  amazing. Shakespeare in love. Why didn't  you want to play Shakespeare? I read  that script of remains the best script  that I've ever read. I was never going  to play a lead when I read that Joe  Fines was playing the lead. I read it  because I was dating at the time or I  don't know if I read it because of that,  but I remember that she was going to be  in it. I read it and loved that  character. It was like the actor who's  full of himself and I thought it was  very funny and I more than that I like  the idea of like a Tom Stopppper  screenplay, you know, to me just seemed  like this this is amazing. this  brilliant guy has actually written a  screenplay for the movies and it was it  was the best screenplay I've ever read.  I loved it and I loved making the movie  and it was a thrill and an honor to do.  Chasing Amy, how do you feel like this  film has aged? At the time, what I  thought was sort of interesting about it  was that it kind of alluded to a a  spectrum  of sexual orientation because there was  to me it was very suggestive around the  homosexuality between the two friends of  the relationship. What does a love  relationship between men look like too?  You know, you love this other man. We  have friendships with men that we love  very much. And it was a way of looking  at well how is this also similar to like  homosexual relationships or or maybe  there is a sort of again a continuum or  a spectrum. And I thought that was kind  of honest and frankly I found myself  having to challenge my own kind of  internalized homophobia because I found  it so difficult to kiss Jason. And I  thought like I this is really  embarrassing like I you know this is  clearly some internalized thing because  why should that be a difficult thing to  do for me? And I thought I still think I  did a shitty an unconvincing job of it  and feel very disappointed by that. And  I would love the chance to to do better  at that. Although of course now I'm not  sure that it the idea of playing a gay  character would be welcome or I might be  like aversive to that because I think  well I don't want to you know offend  anyone in this direction. It was a movie  that like at the time, you know, sort of  felt like it was pushing some boundaries  and in retrospect, as often happens,  like the world has evolved. The Last  Fuel,  how do you and Matt keep your working  relationship fresh? That movie was very  it was we we having written it with  Nicole and really being interested in  the kind of experimental notion of the  idea of point of view and that you know  that we really do as people bring into  any interaction with one another our  history, our culturation, our trauma,  our hopes, our expectations and view the  the present moment through the prism of  that glass. you can really walk away  from the same experience, the same  conversation with different ideas in  retrospect about sort of what took  place. It was also a story about the  vestigial aspects of the patriarchy that  we've sort of inherited culturally and  looking at what those looked like kind  of run riot. uh to me seemed to be  informative and telling about the  present day kind of in keeping with the  theme of this discussion and you like  there's and yet that was what 2020 or  something and here 5 years later that  seems like a long time ago  dogma what did Kevin Smith tell you and  Matt about this story I don't really  have a very firm grasp on exact the  nuances of the complic conversations we  had I know that Matt and I read that  script I read it when I was doing  Chasing Amy and and I viewed I love the  script of Dogma and really viewed  Chasing Amy as an audition for Dogma.  And I remember that we left Pittsburgh  filming Dogma to go back for the Oscars  when Matt and I won the Oscar for  writing. And I remember that that was a  time in my life where like one day was  one thing and the next day was something  totally different. And I think in  retrospect because that was the most  viewed Oscars in however long because of  Titanic. And so we happened to kind of  be riding the coattales of that. And I  think a hell of a lot more people knew  who we were from seeing us as the kids  who won the Oscar on the show than from  watching the movie at the time. But  nonetheless, I I I I felt like I left  the set one day kind of anonymous and  came back and there was like people  outside my trailer won my autograph and  I thought like this is a prank. I  thought Kevin like made it playing a  joke on us. School ties. Do you think  this was your career launcher? I mean, I  kind of did at the time, but I only had  like three lines. Once again, I was this  incredibly  unlikable like horrible anti-semitic  bully. That's when I started being like,  what is it about me that people what am  I giving off like uh these bully vibes?  Nonetheless, I was thrilled to do it.  And you know, that was very much like it  was all these other young actors and  they were all people who I was  auditioning for the same stuff with and  we all hung out and had a good time. And  Matt had a great part and obviously I  was friends with Matt and it was nice to  do that with him but even I think  halfway through I was like this might  not be the big break for me.  M rats. How did Kevin Smith pitch this  to you? Kevin didn't pitch it to me. I  came in auditioned for that movie and  read the sides at the time. I was  playing a lot of guys that you know  throw teenagers into lockers and I was  at risk of becoming like a professional  onscreen bully and I really didn't want  to play that part. But because I was  such a fan of Clerks, I went and  auditioned for it and I just sucked up  to Kevin until he cast me. Smoking Aces.  What was fun about this for you? Joe  Carneahan put me in that movie where and  and I liked the idea of like this is a  guy you think is like going to be in the  movie and a lead in the movie and he  gets killed right away. I thought that  was really fun. I remember Chris Pine in  that movie and I Joe reminded me  recently that I said if there's anybody  I would love to have like a if I could  like buy stock in an actor early, it  would be this actor. He's really good.  He had a small part in that movie, but I  thought he this guy's good and funny and  really good-looking, you know. Uh, so I  thought, well, his things are going to  pan out for him, so I can say I did call  that extract.  Did Mike Judge do Beous and Butad on  set? He didn't. But I sometimes do that  when my son's on TikTok too long and he  says like nuts and like nuts, ass balls.  Just saying balls is not funny. There's  no wit in that. Just saying balls or  penis. Like why is that a joke? Sorry.  One of my favorite performances of mine  of all time. I love Extract. I love the  movie. I love Mike Judge. I love Jason  Baitman. I love JK Simmons. It was  spectacular. Jersey girl, tell us about  working with George Carlin. Oh my god, I  love doing that movie too. I love Kevin.  We had a beautiful time together. Var  Sigman shot that movie. Jen was great.  Liv was great. And George Carlin was  such a Raquel, the actress who played  the young girl, you know, by the way,  she's like whatever 30 now or some crazy  thing. But George was a wonderful guy  and a and a hero of mine and to get to  work with him and get to know him was an  a honor and a treat. Jay and Silent Bob  reboot. Is there something that really  resonates with you about this movie?  There's a lovely monologue about  fatherhood in that movie. Um the words  of which I still remember which are like  you're you know becoming a father means  that you're not the star, you're the  stage. And that has like resonated with  me and been true and and I I think it's  a lovely way of articulating the  transition and the kind of real meaning  of of life that's discovered in that  process. Hollywood Land. What broke your  heart about George Reeves? Hollywood  Land extremely moving story, lovely  director. Adrien Brody I loved Diane  Lane I loved. again like had the chance  to work with really gifted people and I  put a lot of weight for the role and I  remember it was really hard to take it  off. I found it be to be Bob Hoskins in  the movie. It was a beautiful  heartbreaking story about a guy who who  did really get kind of pigeonholed in  this role and the way that that affected  his life and I had some things I could  identify with that. not the obvious ones  or not identical ones, but I understood  that you can go into these experiences,  movies, you know, any kind of public  life sort of thinking about the job  you're doing or viewing it as a job  without any sense of what effects and  the unintended consequences might be of  that and then you live with them. So, I  felt a lot of compassion, empathy for uh  Reeves.  The way back, what was your experience  of playing this character? The Way Back  was a really wonderful experience for  me. Even though the story of I mean  somebody losing a child is like the  worst possible thing that can happen to  you. And I I really have a difficult  time imagining or even wanting to  imagine that I am in recovery and sober  myself. So the alcoholism that the guy  kind of descended into is something that  I could kind of draw on personal  experiences for. But really, Gavin is a  wonderful director and all of his  movies, whether it's Miracle or Warrior,  you know, or or Counter The Way Back. He  has a real interest in and attention to  the people themselves. And he's a great  director for actors because he really  wants the performance to be good and he  I think he has really good taste in  terms of what he uses. that felt like  very much the beginning of a period in  my life and I guess career as an actor  where I just wanted to do parts that I  personally was really interested in  doing and exploring as an actor and kind  of let go a little bit of this concern  that I think comes with you know any  kind of performing job where you know  you're performing in the audience  obviously is is a part of that awareness  of the audience and the hope that the  audience likes it and wanting and I  think that can lead to wanting to get  you know people to see and get positive  feedback and I kind of was able to let  go of some of that sort of do they like  it, what do they think and not think so  much about the I don't know all the  strategy of a career and all that stuff  which I'm not very good at anyway and  really you know ironically of course I  feel like that's when I started to  really feel the most comfortable and  have the most fun as an actor live by  night why do we keep coming back to  gangster movies hard to say it's so  there's something about the gangster  movie that's just has a very lasting  appeal. I think in some ways because  it's writ large the the ambitions that  we have. I'm going to do something in my  life. I'm going to, you know, I have  these dreams. I want to be successful.  But there's also something kind of  provocative and scary and alluring about  doing it within a world where the stakes  are kind of life and death. I think that  The Godfather and Godfather 2 also have  a lot to do with that because those  films were so iconic that it sort of  established that genre as the great  genre of cinema. Um, but you know, it  Angels with Dirty Faces was was an  inspiration for me with with with The  Town and Live by Night. And after Argo,  I thought this is probably the only  chance I'm going to have to do a a  period gangster movie. And I still feel  like as a director in terms of the  technical execution of the movie, I feel  like that's probably my best work in  some ways. I'm every sort of shot in  that movie I put together in a way that  was I felt was complicated and  interesting and complimentary to the  movie. And when I look back on it, I  really love the movie. And I and I kind  of love what it what it had to say. In  particular, the theme around the urgency  and the immediacy of like this life  right now and the present moment rather  than a distant reward in heaven or or  even in the future. It's like this is  it. This is what we have only right now.  We can't change the past. We're not in  the future. The idea of sort of  postponing that or assigning like well I  I'm going to tolerate this life until  some point at the future that just  doesn't come. You know what we have is  is the present moment. This is sort of a  Buddhist idea, but one that I was really  drawn to. And I God, I love that movie.  Glory days. Tell us where the goatee  came from. That was Rich's idea. Rich is  the haircut, the fauxhawk, and the  drumming. I learned to drum the punk  rock music and the thing. That was that  was Will cuz I was being I was being  rich in college in Santa Cruz. You know,  not everything ages well. Not It didn't  even play well at the time. Actually, I  don't think it didn't even play at the  time because it didn't come out, but All  right. Go ahead. Okay. Now, what's the  first thing that comes to mind when I  say this film, Reindeer Games? Uh, I  love working with Well, I love working  with John Frankenheimer. He was a tough  guy and he yelled all the time, but he  was he'd obviously been through some  kind of anger management course because  he would be like, \"Props. What the [ __ ]  is wrong with this? This is the worst  [ __ ] props I've ever seen.\" And then  he'd walk like three steps over a craft  service and he'd go, \"This is the best  sandwich I've ever had.\" You was like,  \"Oh, I somebody told him like say  something nice after you.\" And so he  always knew after he bitched somebody  out. I always try to get close to him.  Best actor you've ever worked with or  The sum of all fears. Some fears. Alec  and Harrison had played that part. So it  was quite daunting. I had been in Phil a  Phil Alden Robinson movie before, but  only as an extra in Field of Dreams.  Playing Jack Ryan was amazing  opportunity. It was this iconic part. I  worried and felt that I wasn't up to the  task and then sort of tried to bring  that insecurity and as somebody a critic  remarked insucience I had to look the  word up at the time to the role. It  means a sort of like fecklessness like  uh not really capable enough you know  but you know young and you know like you  know you know underqualified I guess  that movie also I got to I loved  Montreal and and I met and got to work  with one of my heroes and Morgan  Freeman. Additionally a wonderful  benefit because he was kind enough to  come do my first movie I directed.  Spoiler room. It was my homage to  Glengary Glenn Ross and Alec Bowwin's  performance. It was really fun. is  probably the best two days I've ever  done in a movie. The Company Men,  John Wells, lovely guy. Uh Tommy Lee,  Chris Cooper, and I a very sad movie,  but one that was really connected to  what was going on in the country at the  time. To the wonder. I love Terry Malik.  I love him and I've never had an  experience like it before.  Forces of nature,  Brahma Hughes, uh, Sandra Bulock, and a  a really beautiful, fun experience in  Savannah that I will always remember  with huge fondness and nostalgia, the  Tinder Bar. Loved that part very and a  good time in my life when I felt  wonderful and good about acting and I  love doing it. And George, I had one of  the best relationships with a with a a  director in terms of my performance I've  ever had. I felt like this was a guy  with and I was in great hands with the  dark end of the street.  My first movie I was 7 years old and I  got it by nepatism because my mom's best  friend was the casting director and also  the wife of the director Jan Eaglesen  and they needed a little kid to be  sleeping in a bed and to say a line and  I I I was seven and I don't really  remember but I'm sure I was great state  of play. Kevin McDonald is terrific.  That was a a really uh interesting  experience shooting in DC. I did a lot  of research in Congress. It was a really  intense interesting experience to work  with Jason and Rachel McAdams and like I  mean it was just spectacular. Ellen  Mirren uh Robin Wright who's one of the  best actor I've ever worked with. Robin  Wright is incredible. I mean you go into  a scene with Robin and it's like all of  a sudden she just makes everything true  and real. I mean she can carry another  actor. She's a genius. Well I worked  with her and I thought oh this is what  can be done. I remain just in awe of  her. I tried to get her in movies, but  she's always unavailable. So, Changing  Lanes,  love that movie. Loved Roger Michelle,  who is a beautiful director. I've tried  to emulate Roger's casting of of  performances in every single person in  the movie. Met Bradley Cooper, been a  lifelong friend, I suppose, since then  on that movie. Sam Jackson is like a guy  just admired enormously and was thrilled  to work with. and Tony Colette and  Amanda Pete. I I really liked that movie  and it was the first time I got a chance  to do it a script that was really good  and I could sink my teeth into and I I  really felt like I wanted to prove  something with that movie and I was  ultimately proud of it on balance. He's  just not that into you. I don't remember  one thing about them except the DP. I  remember the cinematography was uh John  um please dad now. Anyway, okay.  Obviously, it's not staying with me. All  these movies, you know, the final result  you really care about, but at the end of  the day, what they mean to me really has  to do with the experience and and what I  learned. It's fun. Walk down memory lane  makes me feel old. Like that guy was  like, \"Before there was talking in  movies.\" You know what I mean? The kind  of people I look at all the young  people, they're like, \"Oh, wow. You knew  PT Barnum.\" It's like, \"That's right.",

      "page_content": "I actually like don't watch movies I've  been in so I'm never considering how  they're going to be perceived by an  audience I'm like my harshest critic so  I go into every project very worried  that I'm going to screw it up and really  working hard to try my best to  [Music]  not the social network Mark  Zuckerberg okay you are probably going  to be a very successful computer  person you're going to go through life  thinking that girl don't like you  because you're a nerd and I want you to  know from the bottom of my heart that  that won't be  true it'll be because you're an [ __ ]  it was my job at all times to kind of  think about my role as somebody virtuous  and Noble and well-meaning because  that's how people tend to think of  themselves irrespective of how sometimes  their behavior is perceived I was just  trying to  like understand the best possible  version of this person and then play the  scenes which don't exactly present the  best possible version of that person but  inside he is thinking that and as an  actor you're in this very strange place  where you know I've played like movie  villains before you always have to think  of yourself as the hero of the story you  always have to think of yourself as  well-intentioned even if you know in  like a superhero movie like the villain  is like you know killing people and you  know he has his own logic and his own  reason and it's the actor's job more  than anybody's to kind of figure out  what that is even if an audience might  never be able to tell you don't think I  deserve your attention I think if your  clients want to sit on my shoulders and  call themselves tall they have a right  to give it a tribe there's no  requirement that I enjoy sitting here  listening to people  lie you have part of my attention you  have the minimum amount the rest of my  attention is back at the offices of  Facebook where my colleagues and I are  doing things that no one in this room  including and especially your clients  are intellectually or creatively capable  of  doing did I adequately answer your  condescending question I truly don't  read about like the real person that  much probably cuz I don't want to feel  like an association with it and I really  only thought of the character as a movie  character I thought of the character  that I was playing as like any kind of  fictional character where I'm not kind  of trying to compare you know uh what  I'm doing to a real person you know the  idea is to kind of play a character and  in Drama characters have to be  especially if they're like leading  characters have to be understandable in  some way not necessarily always  sympathetic but understandable in some  ways so it was my job to kind of at  least understand where he's coming from  and this is a guy who felt socially  excluded but who was probably smarter  than everybody else and figured out a  way to become socially included but only  if he can be in complete control of it  and so there's like a kind of  unsustainability to that but um I  understood like at least the character  not the person I understood the  character's righteousness I understood  the character's inner life why he would  feel resentment and anger and rage and  superiority all that stuff is easy to  justify when you're acting and when  you're trained as an actor to think  about getting inside the character's  head  head the people who are making the movie  the writer and director are like the  best in their fields I did have this  feeling that I could do anything I could  try anything and it would all be okay  partly that's because the director like  does tons of takes so you can kind of  experiment um knowing that if it's  really far off they just won't use it um  so I played the character two different  ways um we would do like half the takes  kind of in this kind of socially removed  way where the character was not like  kind of picking up on social cues or  perceiving other characters uh in her  lives and then we would do the other  half a little more what I would call  just natural somebody who is a little  more or socially engaged and then they I  guess put together a version of the  movie that probably incorporates both so  the character probably appears really  disengaged at times in an unnerving way  and probably at other times feels very  passionate about what he's talking about  if I had to kind of think about how the  movie is  perceived from the outside I would only  be able to make a guess which is that  it's a really well-made art piece um  that is talking about something that has  existed forever which is kind of um you  you know people who are probably not the  best managers getting control of a large  group of people and the organization  kind of like falling you know into the  traps of whatever that person's personal  flaws are and that's a really compelling  story Citizen Kane obviously did it so  many years earlier it's talking about a  transition in time where socialization  kind of switched from in-person  interactions and telephone calls and  what we might call slow conversation  slow socialization and went into the  fast food of socialization where you can  be in touch with hundreds of people at  once and just like fast food it becomes  like less nutritious each individual  relationship and so I think it's showing  that and it's doing it in such an  interesting way because instead of doing  it on the kind of ground level of  showing people whose social lives are  being dis diminished um in value because  of this technology it's actually showing  the people who created the technology  almost foisting this in my opinion  unsustainable world view onto the public  at large so I guess there's that kind of  thing which kind of raises these big  stakes and speaks to a Moment In  Time Adventure Land James  [Music]  Brennan um yeah I'll meet you  inside okay I'll will meet you inside  okay  okay [ __ ]  boner You Got a Boner br's Got a Boner  that movie for me was like I it was  like a my first movie with that like  level of part and I was just so nervous  the whole time I do remember reading the  script and just being kind of shocked  that it existed because this was like  probably 2007 2008 Greg had just  directed super bad and the movies that  were being made around that time was  like really Jud appe how style broader  comedies characters are improvising and  it didn't have as much of a Melancholy  undertone and so when I read that script  I was kind of just shocked that anybody  was making it because it was so  different than everything I had been  reading at the time which was just more  broadly comedic and which I was not as  good at as an actor when I met him I  just said I I just I can't believe you  wrote this it's so beautiful it's just  so beautiful and he said that yeah  that's what I'm trying to do I want to  make like this kind of sweet Melancholy  thing and then it's so funny because um  when they ended up putting out the movie  they made it look like the kind of  broadest version of itself it's just  it's not that at all I I hear all the  time people love the movie Adventure  Land because I think it has this real  heart to it that you know gives it a  certain kind of longevity little more  than 40% of these fish are dead I'm  amazed at how tiny my paycheck is I've  been working doubles but we are doing  the work of pathetic lazy morons  Adventure L had some of the greatest  comic actors in the world Bill ha and  Kristen wig were in the movie and  normally I would feel I think really you  know in over my head out of my depth in  deep water when I'm used to shallow  water I don't know what the expression  is but I wouldn't feel comfortable the  movie had this really kind of like  melancholic dramatic undertone and I  felt actually was like my job as the  central character to kind of like  maintain that so in fact I just felt so  glad to be able to work with people like  that um why don't you give the kid a  [ __ ]  Panda go your Panda yeah thanks when we  were doing adventure L Kristen Stewart  was 17 which is like sounds like not a  very young person but when you're doing  a movie you're like constantly aware of  their age because 17-year-olds can't  work past a certain time and they have  to go to school and everything and she  was just like the most powerful co-actor  I've ever met until that point we did a  scene in a car where we're driving over  a bridge and it's this kind of sweet  montage and I'm just like staring at her  and I think I say one word and I think  she says one word hey can we  gowhere yeah and we parked the car the  bridge they were setting up the lights  we had a few minutes in between setups  and I went to the director Greg mat and  I  said I this is like a movie star I said  I don't know what a movie star is but I  think now I do she had a certain kind of  intensity and lived in quality I kind of  like i' never seen it before i' worked  with like amazing actors because I had  grown up doing theater working with like  great actors but I don't think I'd ever  seen anybody that just had this kind of  like um innate quality that was so  engaging and like preder naturally like  emotionally accessible I've worked with  her now a few times and I've had that  same experience each time she makes me  nervous cuz she's like has an  intimidating presence luckily the movies  we did together I think actually all I  think support that  [Music]  relationship Greg Mata to this day is  like one of like the two nicest people  I've ever worked with I'll never forget  because it made such an impact on me  more as a director even than an actor  but one day on set it was a scene where  I'm like saying goodbye to my parents  cuz I'm going to the big city I don't  think you even hear the dialogue of the  movie but basically I just had like a  panic attack and it was the first time I  ever had a panic attack on set and I  just like shut down and I was not able  to like I just you know you have that  strange outof body sensation and I went  to Greg and I said I am so sorry I just  had a panic attack I think I don't know  what happened and I'm so sorry I screwed  up the scene and he took me aside he  didn't like talk to me in front of  people he took me aside and he said I am  not an actor I don't understand how  you're not having panic attacks at every  single moment on a movie set you're  being scrutinized you're using your own  emotions you're in a costume that's not  your costume somebody's done your hair  you have makeup on and you're standing  there emoting something that is not true  to your life and I just had this weight  lifted off of my shoulders I was like  probably 25 years old and uh I had been  like a kind of a nervous performer up  until that point and then when he gave  me permission to feel nervous suddenly I  didn't anymore and as a director now I I  always just think what the actors are  doing here is so exposing and vulnerable  and I appreciate every moment that  they're on set and uh it just changed my  perception of how we could think about  actors Batman versus Superman Lex  [Music]  Luther hi hello Lex it is a pleasure ow  wow that is a good grip you should not  pick a fight with this person with a  movie where there's like a real Cannon  like Batman vers Superman and the part  that I was playing there's like a kind  of Canon certain expectations from an  audience there's nothing that I could  personally do besides playing my role as  good as I can play it thinking about  this character's history and what made  him so malevolent and so angry and  self-hating to me that you know it's  felt like playing any other role the  fact that it has like this kind of  specific expectations and historical  perceptions is something that like I'm  not in control of and I guess if I were  to try to control it I probably wouldn't  do that great a job as an actor because  I'm thinking about this like you know  like find product rather than what I'm  supposed to be thinking about which is  what would this character feel in this  moment and why does he feel that way and  how could I kind of get myself as close  to those shoes as possible playing in a  Batman movie doesn't mean I have to do  my job any differently in fact it  requires me to do my job at the highest  possible level because the movie is such  a big movie and my part was so  wonderfully written and special so I  love doing it no I I loved it it was so  funny because you know when you're  acting in a movie typically your job  doesn't change based on the budget  typically you know you're sitting in  front of a camera and you're doing scene  workor and you're thinking about your  character's inner life and your  emotional experience and that doesn't  really change if there's a kind of huge  green screen and a styrofoam Batcave  behind you it's really the job is the  same which is this very kind of like  intimate emotional experience it was  just funny to be on that set because I  felt like I was doing my regular job but  just in front of you know multi-million  dollar sets and it was amazing to see  The Artisans they get the best artisans  in the world to work on these movies  because you know they're like paying the  most money and so you get to see some of  the most amazing art down to every prop  every set piece every painting on the  wall That's bespoke and made for that  particular scene and it was just  exhilarating I figured out way back if  God is all powerful he cannot be all  good and if he is all good then he  cannot be all powerful and neither can  you be they need to see the fraud you  are with their  eyes my character I guess you could call  him xenophobic he viewed Superman as an  alien who was a threat to the society  that I held dear now we think of  politics like that as kind of like  xenophobic and you know anti-immigrant  you might call I mean it's strange to to  to even speak about it uh in kind of  modern political terms but like the way  I thought about it is here is somebody  who's coming who is  a who's more powerful than our  civilization and they pose obviously  they pose a threat in the way you might  think now of AI posing a threat  something this powerful should not exist  if we were making the movie today I  think my analog would probably be that  Superman represents some kind of like AI  where like we don't know what it can do  and yes it has this power but we can't  control what that power is so why even  take the risk when you think about it  that way it's very easy to get into the  head of that character because he has  kind of like making a good point which  is like a lot of people making now ai is  unknown and therefore more dangerous  than we can possibly conceive of that's  the way I guess I work as an actor you  know you're trying to kind of get inside  the emotional inner life of your  character and justify their behavior  however different it might be from your  own Zombie Land  [Music]  Columbus so I'm on my way from my  college dorm in Austin Texas to Columbus  Ohio where I'm hoping my parents are  still alive even though we were never  really close just be nice to see a  familiar face or any face that doesn't  have blood dripping from its lips and  flesh between its teeth the Zombie Land  movies are like these unexpectedly  beloved movies you know I say  unexpectedly only because they're like  quite violent so you don't expect like  people to come up to you all the time  and said I finally watched that movie  with my family I've been waiting to  watch that movie with my family it's  just like kind of like uh not what you  expect from a movie like that when I  think about it and when I think about  like what the experience actually was  like doing it it had this like very kind  of warm feeling similar to Adventure  Land being kind of a um kind of sweet  comedy this felt like kind of a sweet  genre movie the characters were sweet  the four of us are all dramatic actors  and so we kind of approach the movie  from the same you know dramatically  responsible place of who are these  people what are they going through you  know I remember like Woody Harrelson's  character has a thing where like you  think he's talking about missing his dog  and it turns out he's missing his kid I  mean it's this incredibly high stakes  dramatic emotional uh circumstances and  so we were all playing it legitimately  and so the movie was really funny but it  also had this kind of like emotional  quality to it I guess that makes people  love these movies so much is that it  feels like the characters are relatable  even though the circum ances are so you  know extreme and absurd losing but  that's his  puppy I'll tell you I never thought I  could love anything like Buck just day  he was born I just lost my mind I just  finished my fifth project with Woody  harlson three days ago I've worked with  Woody harlson more than I've worked with  anybody in my life which seems so  strange only because we so different I  just remember improvising with him in  the first Zombie Land being so impressed  that he improvised in character he  doesn't improvise jokes and I just love  that because I like improv but I don't  love improv where you're kind of just  throwing random jokes into make the  people around you laugh I love  improvisation when it's in the spirit of  the character I just remember thinking  this guy is just an unbelievable genius  and the way I think about him in general  is like he's a true unusual artist and a  brilliant one but the public perceives  him as this kind of like regular guy and  he is in that he is a kind of regular  guy but he's a very unusual artist um he  just has this kind of genial quality  that I think makes him very relatable  but I don't think that's like by  Design Now You See Me J Daniel  [Music]  Atlas that was too fast I'll do it again  are you ready mhm  okay did you see one yes do you have one  in mind yes and do you see your card  here no that's because you're looking  too closely what have I been telling you  all night The Closer you look the less  you  see when I signed on to the movie Now  You See Me they told me that they were  like changing the script and if I had  input into my character I now is the  time to give it the script was great and  everything but they allowed me to kind  of alter my character and I remember  just thinking I want to play something I  never played before can I just play this  person who is you know Brash and  arrogant and really confident and has no  self out and it's just this really weird  experience where when I was acting in  the movie and I just literally finished  the third one uh less than a week ago I  just feel great about myself it's this  strange thing now a lot of characters I  play are kind of like tortured  self-hating you know misanthropic  self-aware kind of people and when I'm  playing the Now You See Me character  which I've gotten to do now three times  I just feel so great at the end of the  day I think the set went perfectly um  after a scene I think it went perfect uh  between takes I'm excited about doing  another take take I have no self-doubt  and it's because I'm living in the  spirit of this character who has no  self-doubt I might be terrible in the  movie I don't know I just it's the only  times I really feel like I'm great and  it's because the character feels like  he's great and it's like just the  biggest psychological and emotional  relief for me to do these movies I hope  they do 10 more it' be a little  difficult to make it rain right that  would be something that only God can do  right CU I'm going to do something that  God can't do I'm not just going to make  it clear up no no no no no I'm going to  make it actually stop  my relationship with magic has not  changed as much as my relationship with  the Public's thinking that I have a  relationship with magic like I can't  really do anything wonderful magically  but that's because like the people who  do do it and I've worked now with like  the greatest magicians in the world  because of course they're like our  Consultants because it's like a big  movie we have access to like the  greatest magicians what they do is such  a skill set that requires just years and  years of practice I mean I'm obviously  not at that level so I know a few things  and this new movie Now You See me3 we  tried to do most um kind of effects in  camera as opposed to like computer  generated effects a lot of the magic  that the characters do in this movie are  not like just slight of hand I mean  they're huge like rub Goldberg MIT level  thought experiments like making it rain  and then making the rain stop this is  like a thing that you can do practically  but it's just requires like just a  brilliant mind and so uh I actually  don't have to do that much magic but  because I'm so associated with these  movies I do often get asked to do magic  on the street and I usually just quickly  change the subject and uh ask them where  they're from and say nice to meet  you the end of the tour David  lipsky if I could uh I I'd say to David  that living those days with him reminded  me of what life is like instead of being  a relief from  it and I tell him it made me feel much  less alone the end of the tour is a  movie I love so much the relationship I  had with the director James ponel was  one of the highlights of my life as well  as the relationship with Jason seagull  the other actor it felt like we were  really on the same team and it was a  very immersive experience we were all in  Michigan during like one of the coldest  winters that they had seen on Lake  Michigan it just felt like we would wake  up and shoot the movie all day and then  go to sleep and then wake up and shoot  the movie all day that sounds like a  typical job but what I really mean is  that it was so immersive that we never  left each other's sides it's the Two of  Us in every moment in the movie and we  shot long hours and it was freezing and  it was really small budget and so we  were basically shooting like 15 hours  instead of just working 25 days we  worked 19 days and 20 and 15 hours you  know the character I was playing was a  deeply envious person he is interviewing  a writer that he's deeply deeply envious  of and it was very uncomfortable for me  and very emotional for me to be like in  that role I'm sorry I'm not asking for  like sympathy this is the nature of  being an actor but it just hit me in an  incredibly personal way I don't know if  I was going through something in my  career at that time or something that  for some reason just mirrored what was  happening in that movie and it just was  killing me I really couldn't stop crying  during the scenes and then the director  told me stop crying during the scenes  but it was just like hitting me in an  emotional way that I couldn't explain  even to like a therapist which I was  probably mistakenly not going to at the  time and I just had these very strong  feelings for Jason the actor who's  really wonderful in the movie and he's  an imposing person even and all these  very profound feelings of inadequacies  were like really um uh eating me alive  during that movie and partly because  there was no Break It just I was just in  this world and it actually felt really I  don't know what the word is but it  really felt actually quite uh not  healthy for me I was glad when the movie  ended even though it was really one of  the most creatively inspiring  experiences I've ever had you're not  going to make me look like I'm one of  those insane old women who talks to  their dogs are you um no don't worry  about it I am worried about it my dogs  are going to be offended the dogs are  not going to read this  article I got to tell you they've never  taken to a man who they've taken to you  Jason and I got along like as good as  two people in the world can get along we  were both happy to be doing this movie I  would say even more for him because it  was such a departure for him and I think  it really gave him an opportunity to  show how wonderful he can be in a  dramatic role for me my part was a  little more like kind of similar to  myself and so um he was so thrilled to  be there and I was thrilled because I  love the movie but also very H just  vulnerable because of the part I was  playing and how it dovetailed with my  life in an uncomfortable way and yet  when we were on set we would not stop  laughing uh in between takes I've never  laughed that hard we were just in  hysterics because um we just got along  so well because we weren't in a comedy I  think we needed that catharsis so we  were just laughing all the time I still  remember the jokes that we had on set as  just being like some of the funniest  dumbest jokes I've ever heard in my life  because the scenes were so fraught uh  you know he was a character that was  suicidal and an addict and I was a  character who hated himself to such a  degree that I that he put himself in the  line of fire with this more talented  person it was really just the highs and  lows and they were as high as possible  and then as low as possible because the  scenes were really fraught and the time  in between the scenes were really  funny the squid and the whale wal  [Music]  burkman you weren't even a writer until  recently you just failed on dad cuz he's  not as successful as he used to be and  hasn't gotten the recognition he  deserves you sound like your father no  I'm glad I sound like him you disgust me  you're being a [ __ ] wall  I know for the director was a very  personal story and I was playing him as  a young man and so I can understand now  you know why the part was really  sensitive to cast but at the time it  just felt like this very exciting and  also nerve-wracking lingering experience  because it took place over the course of  like a few months that you know I would  go back for this movie audition for the  same three people in the room it was  like this kind of lingering thing and it  was so good I mean the script was so  good everybody thought so because I was  friends with young actors and everybody  was just like this is unbelievable and  what a great part for a young man it was  in New York and the people were making  it were just so smart and talented it  felt like I was part of like the cool  kids table for like a few months I don't  know how to describe it other than that  it felt like we were working on like an  amazing art piece that was really  special but at the same time very funny  and I just felt I guess like a kind of  pressure to live live up to it it shot  very quickly you know something like 20  days they even had to cut out these  amazing scripted scenes because there  was no time or money to do these scenes  and it's funny cuz looking back the  movie is like a classic movie and it's  you know beloved and live on forever but  at the time it was literally like oh we  can't shoot this great scene from this  great script that everybody loves  because there's no time and money so  instead we're going to do it in a  hallway or a science class or something  when it was like this really funny  choreograph Scene It really felt cool I  was going to Brooklyn every day I don't  know I just have I have I have the  visceral memories of that movie that  just made me feel like I was part of  something really unusual I regret  sometimes I wasn't more of a pre agent  when I was younger there was a woman who  approached me at a party at George  plimpton's after my first book she was  very sexy I could have gone home with  her why didn't you I was with your  mother oh right of  course you should have probably done it  it didn't stop her the crew was made up  of like some of the greatest artisans in  the world like our cinematographer was  Wes Anderson cinematographer also the  other half of the crew was uh Noah's um  former students of Vasser and they were  my age so I was like friends with the  young crew members who were like  essentially in like interning on the  movie and yet um we were working for  like the greatest like gaffer in New  York City was the gaffer and so it was  this really kind of unusually  bifurcated uh set experience it was  great for me because I got along with  people who are in my kind of Generation  Um but I also knew I was working with  these people who are amazing it just  felt like the script was so perfect we  didn't have to do anything I've been  involved in a few movies where it felt  like script is so good you just have to  show up and  I don't know not try to put a spin on  something you know what I mean not try  to like uh how can I take this in the  direction that I want to take it in  sometimes you do that in a movie and  it's really helpful because maybe the  movie is missing a little personality or  something and so you feel like as an  actor I have a little bit more  responsibility here to kind of take it  in a more interesting Direction and with  that movie it just felt like this is so  good we can I can be we could just you  know we just stand in front of a white  wall and do this and it would be great  the set was very quick moving um every  scene was shot I if I'm remembering  correctly very quickly except for the  very last scene where the character I  play goes into like this Museum of  Natural History and goes up to this  diarama I remember that um being shot  from multiple angles on a dolly with a  you know an arm moving up to do a  beautiful move and I remember feeling  like oh oh suddenly this all feels like  very real and less  spontaneous fman is in trouble Toby  FL for the 10th time that day Toby was  forced to asked the question that  occurred to him nearly every few minutes  since his separation how did I get here  how did I become a divorced guy how  could my kids be so much like these  people when they also so resembled me I  loved the book fleshman is in trouble I  love the writer she's one of my best  friends and she's just a genius she's a  creative Powerhouse and I really loved  doing the show the weird part of the  show is that my life is being narrated  by somebody he gathered all he had to go  in there whatever it was he could handle  it and so what you're seeing in my  character is essentially like the  leading character in somebody else's  book and it's strange to play that  there's no real way to play that as an  actor you can't play the kind of like  meta textual remove the show presents  itself in this really kind of brilliant  observational way where you're looking  at my character from outside but as an  actor you just can't think of it that  way at all as an actor you have to just  kind of think of what is my character  going through now and you you don't  think of yourself as a cog you think of  yourself as the lead it was kind of  interesting to do that and I always knew  that there would be this other element  in the show I was working with just some  of the greatest actors Lizzy Caplin who  I've worked with a bunch of times now  Claire Dan who's to this day maybe like  the most intensely dramatic scene  partner I've ever had she's just on  another level I and Adam Brody who I  just got along with so well and we had  this really kind of funny strangely  tepid masculine relationship in this uh  in this show I love the show so much  without even a appreciating what it was  doing on this kind of other level and  because I don't watch myself I've never  appreciated the show as this other thing  I've always just  appreciated being this character you  have to understand that Toby was not  exactly a desired property in his youth  so handsome what I learned about online  dating is that I personally would not  farewell on those platforms and I'm so  lucky that I met my wife before the  internet I know when like I go to  parties I'm not a a good partygoer  because I'm not um fun and so I know  when I have somebody cornered in a room  I could talk to them and I appear like a  human being online apps I wouldn't  appear like a person and at parties I  won't appear like a person and I'm kind  of just happy I'm 41 and not 21 because  I existed at a time where I could I  guess Thrive  more the double Simon James and James  [Music]  Simon you're not thinking of killing  yourself are you sorry it's a simple  question no should I put him down as a  no put him down as a  maybe the double it was my other  favorite collaboration of all time with  Richard IAT the director who is my idol  and a genius and one of my best friends  brought such Artistry to this movie to  every little moment but I will say it  was the first time I felt like this is a  gift I normally I feel nervous on sets I  know when the Big scenes are coming up  and you feel a little anxious as they  approach this movie I felt like this is  the gift I was I think like you know 30  at the time I filmed it and I've been  acting since I was young so I was like  oh this is what I've been working for to  feel this and I just wish it could have  gone on forever um I felt like I was  there to use the full extent of my  Artistry I was playing two characters  this kind of like shy character and this  very Brash obnoxious character and I  just felt like this is everything that I  know how to do well this is everything  that I've like worked on in my life and  in my craft and with drama school and  with acting in movies and acting in  movies that were not good and acting in  parts that were thankless this is the  gift this is like this is just a gift I  I felt that one other time with a movie  The Art of self-defense I was on set  just feeling like God if I could just do  this every day be in this character  shoes every day I feel like I know  exactly what I'm doing and I feel like  I'm working to the best of my abilities  even directing a movie now that I'm  acting in that I wrote I still don't  feel like I'm working to the best of my  abilities even though it is like all the  things I can do with the double and the  Art of self-defense I just felt like if  I can have two more experiences like  this in my my life where I feel like I'm  working to the best of my abilities I  will be very  happy a real pain David  [Music]  Kath the movie in some ways like answers  a question I have which is like I'm kind  of a depressive so I kind of like walk  around feeling not bad for myself but  feeling bad like I would say maybe more  about myself or something I then punish  myself how could I possibly feel that  there's Wars going on all over the world  and hurricanes how could I possibly feel  bad about myself my life is so  comfortable I'm so lucky I'm have the  luck of you know 10,000 people I'm so  lucky the movie is trying to kind of  like contend with that it's these two  characters who both have like what I  would call modern-day demons like my  character has like you know medicated  OCD you know and like obsessive  compulsive disorder and anxiety right  and kieran's character has some darker  but individual demons you know Grandma  never pied herself in fact she always  told me she was grateful for her  struggle well that's just it what she  endured that gave her hope right yes in  fact she used to tell me that like you  know uh first generation immigrants work  some like menial job you know they drive  cabs they deliver food second generation  they go to good schools and they become  like you know a doctor or a lawyer or  whatever and uh the third generation  lives in their mother's basement and  smoks pot all day I  mean she said that and they go back to  Poland and they're actually trying to  confront like their family's history  which was much more fraught and  objectively more terrifying than their  lives trying to ask the question of like  what pain is valid is it is it okay  because I I say in the movie I know my  pain is unexceptional so I don't feel  the need to burden everybody with it but  kieran's character I say you know it  feels like he's using his pain  constantly as a weapon to co-opt social  situations I guess that's all when I say  like autobiographical I guess I just  it's all the stuff I think about all the  time and this movie is like kind of  let's say like a fictional discussion of  those questions I have Kieran and I met  which I didn't remember at an audition  for um Adventureland I was already cast  in the part and he came into audition  for a character that like is constantly  hitting me in the balls and in the  audition he also squeezed my nipples  very hard and wouldn't let go it wasn't  in the script and the director said cut  and I I think he didn't hear me he was  yelling at me and so he just continued  to hold me and I remember just being so  intimidated by him even though I was the  one technically like with the  comfortable position because I had  already been cast in the movie and other  people were auditioning for his part and  I remember just thinking this guy is so  talented and so Brazen and so  intimidating and so comfortable with  himself and this must have stayed with  me my mind because the movie is really  that relationship like he kind of  manhandles me and Bullies me and charms  me and I find him very intimidating but  he's this also kind of like spark of of  light maybe this state of my mind  because when somebody suggested him to  me it was immediate of course that's who  should play it I I didn't like  consciously associate back to being  squeezed in my breast but I I guess I  must have had that in my unconscious",

      "page_content": "but where did the pickle even come from  someone's idea to put a pickle sticker  on the hel I hope it's gone no no there  it is it's a damn pickle didn't come out  I don't like to do scenes with stickers  that are more interesting than I am hey  GQ I'm David Leech I'm Ryan Gosling and  I'm Logan holiday today we're going to  break down how we did basically how  Logan did some of the coolest stunts in  our movie The Fall Guy Q fake remote  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  everyone quiet please the reason I put  on these sunglasses is cuz I had to hide  my  fear there's no reason for me to have  sunglasses I fall backwards into  whatever the fictious shot of this  whatever this movie is I mean that's how  we feel a lot of times doing this stuff  it's not that it's not scary it's all  it's always scary you say take the right  precautions you have the experience for  it it was a long process they were  really great with me because they knew I  had like this fear of heights but I  wanted to do this because I mean I tried  to get out of it a million times you  wouldn't let me but in the end I  understood that I needed to do it they  have this thing like it's called green  screen it's called Green Screen you  could just do this and Shrink me but it  was an opportunity to sort of even get a  little bit of a a sliver of the  experience that you guys have every day  of like what you go through and that's  the whole point of this opening sequence  is it starts in the trailer we go all  the way through set you get a sense of  just the day a day of this guy's life  and then he's going up and up and up and  he goes up 12 stories and then they drop  him off a building and so it felt like  the perfect way to start the movie  people ask like how you get actors to do  some of these things having the right  crew creating the element of trust and  then working in a progression we started  in a parking lot and over the course of  many weekends and slowly getting higher  and higher and higher and then also just  kind of developing that that trust and  it's not I thought I might get over my  fear of heights which I did not  unfortunately what I did was just learn  to trust the people around me they were  the best of the best we have to do the  same thing I mean there's plenty of  times you're doing stunts as a performer  where it's not performance dependent it  is absolutely 100% the rig all the  shackles are tight yep you sure okay you  know and they hit the button and you're  like you're like oh God you build this  camaraderie and you build this trust  with each other you start doing a lot of  stuff with a team and you get to know  them and you get comfortable with them  everybody has their job and you just  have to not think about that other  person's job you got to just go okay  well I know that it's good because I  trust them now I just have to do what I  have to do  this was hard to do a cannon roll and  just have a big wreck that's that's  something you could achieve in just one  tank you you put the cannon in the car  you set up you go fast you hit the  cannon how it rolls it rolls not often  are you trying to do like like break a  record you  know I love this scene for so many  reasons you'll see that it's Logan who  who straps me into the seat for this  stunt he goes on to do the stunt break  the world record and then when it's over  you'll see he pulls me out of the car  and Pats me on the back for the stunt he  just did at this point I already done  like five of these things on this movie  right and so then two hours later I'm  pulling you out the car you have to come  Pat me on the back for it we're doing  the scene and I'm helping you take your  helmet and your neck restrain off and  like they start rolling cameras and you  look at me you go this is so [ __ ] up  he goes you just did this and then now  you're helping me get out of it and they  go in action I'm like all right buddy  let's let's go watching this go down is  the most tense day I've ever had on set  knowing you were trying to break the  record so it was like this weird combo  of like counting the roles wanting those  rolls for you but then also worrying  about what every role was doing to you  there's a reason why no one's broken  this record since the early 2000s it's  it was freaking hard it was so technical  you had to have the perfect amount of  pressure in the cannon the pre the right  amount of pressure in the tires the  exact speed you know the entry the sand  density the sand density way the movie  CU we were like God everything has to go  right and you're factoring everything in  look I don't want to be that guy but the  Sands are little loose they level the  sand at the beach out they compact it  they make it better but now it is a  different thing the only difference I  made from the first one we did on camera  that did three end overend to the second  one I did on camera that did eight and a  half sideways was was turning and  holding the turn for 1 second longer  before I hit the button the first one I  did I turned hit the button second one I  turned held it for one more second then  hit the button and that was the  difference yeah because the first wreck  I which we had it was already epic you  know it kind of went up and twisted  sides petted and in any other movie  you'd be like ah this is amazing it'll  be in the trailer everyone's going to  let use different materials and then we  wanted to do something special and you  guys asked to do it again and I'm like I  think we got it in the can like it's  good for the story and you're like no  yeah you really fought for and I wanted  you guys you we really wanted you guys  to have it it was cool the other day I  heard you say someone ask you what was  the difference about this particular  stunt you were like in a lot of stunts  you know you're hoping not to wreck but  this one you know you're going to the  ideal outcome is you don't crash you  jump you clean it everything's clear and  you make it to the other side where the  going bad in a situation like that would  be not making it and crashing and having  a really big wreck what's at least great  about this stunt is that you're wrecking  if I could make it a bigger wreck we we  would have like we we made it the  biggest wreck that it could be the whole  crew was with you everybody was just so  invested you could hear a pin drop we  knew you broke the record but we were  waiting for you to give the thumbs up  and when it comes out just the whole  crew was so elated and erupted and  Applause it was just amazing I remember  thinking like we should make a movie  about this you know and I was like wait  we are things are never perfect  conditions it's like you get to the edge  and they're like oh wait but you got to  wear the boots what and then there's a a  10K in your eyes and you're like wait  and I got to wear the boots and there's  a 10K and they're like in action you're  like what that's why it's real that what  Colt is feeling in the story is real  like wait the sand is loose I told you  guys and they're like we got to keep  going you're like you bumped the camera  like we got seven more that is so it  might seem hyperbolic it is  absolutely the truth the actor doesn't  want to pickle on his helmet we got to  shoot it all over again but the fact  that you came in and you congratulated  me for what you did also in the scene is  just exact I think the whole like the  whole point of this movie is like summed  up in this one scene a  th% I blacked out for most of this you  tell me what's me that's you that's me  this was an early start that's Ben  that's Ben the craziest thing was the  fact that we locked down the Harbor  Bridge and that Ryan was game enough to  just show up kind of uninitiated cuz we  didn't have a chance to rehearse this  hard to rehearse this we did a few kind  of rehearsals in a parking lot but it  was it felt different on the day felt a  little faster more Sparks it was raining  it started to rain and then the dirt is  just kicking up there's no way to stop  it there's no way to block it from you  it was like 5:30 in the morning or  something crazy because you were trying  to like limit the the traffic I'm glad  it was that early because I was so tired  I just kind of walked up to S I was like  held on to the shovel and then it just  hauled my ass across the bridge and I  was like and then it was over and then  we did it a few times and I went back to  the trailer and fell asleep and I was  like that was a really weird dream I  just had or was it a nightmare normally  we talk about the scene and we like make  sure we're making all the right choices  and I just looked at you like we can't  talk there be no talks right now shut up  this morning just do the stun we just  you up I'm already hooking you up like  this and you're like action and you were  beside me in a in like a follow card  both you and Kelly yeah we're like I  could see you guys looking out the  window and I was just like oh my God I  was on the motorcycle right in front of  you trying not to let you catch catch  the bike it's a great way to see Sydney  if you can if you can if you can have  the garbage truck tour of Sydney I  highly recommend it it was funny cuz I  we worked so much I didn't get to get  out very much and sometimes when I did I  would look around and be like this looks  familiar and then I would kind of like  pretend lay down and be like oh yeah I  was here in a garbage truck that's why I  recognize this street continue this  sherad one of those remotes that points  [Music]  there's jeanclaude amazing stunt dog  right stunt performer in his own right  actually did all of his own her her own  stunts what's fun thing about the scene  there's stunts in it obviously but we  were connecting the characters which  makes I think the action more um  exciting you know there's actually  Stakes the Rel is he going to get to  karaoke on time how the hell did you do  this so this is a classic Fall Guy truck  jump kind of like the truck jumps were  on the Fall Guy TV series now not a  really really big one but just a cool  jump to do in the middle of a Chase it's  a little more technical than just  hitting a ramp and going for it because  there's a truck that I'm supposed to  land right behind and if you go a little  bit too fast or you're there too soon  you land on that truck the cameras all  have to catch this so we rehearse this  thing and know exactly how high the  truck goes we also I have a jump  calculator that will calculate exactly  where it's supposed to land I'm not  surprised so I could put in the weight  of the vehicle I could put in the wheel  bit of it the ramp I put in all the  dimensions of everything and it'll tell  us exactly where it's going to land and  it's pretty accurate I mean on this jump  right here it was accurate within one  foot because once you jump this truck  you you ruin it like as soon as this  thing hits the ground it's bent it's  it's not going to do anything else again  so everything has to be just right to  make this thing work Chris goes goes you  could put a camera right there cuz he's  going to he's going to land right here  and I landed right there in the Fall Guy  show you watch multiple times that truck  would just show up from nowhere like it  would just be funny like the middle of  the thing the bad guys are going and  this this truck just lands into frame  and look out for the school  [Music]  bus so we were playing with that but I  think after a couple audience screenings  they're like where's that truck coming  from you can't really do this type of  jump just sitting in the seat being  strapped down because there's way too  much GeForce on the landing going down  it would be hard on your spin so you're  suspended above the seat yeah so I had  them take the stock seat out put in a  racing seat but only for the purposes of  it being extra low and wear a full  harness that grabs my legs in my torso  and then we put pulley in the in the  roof right here above me and the ropes  go up into those pulleys down behind me  and then they're into a really stiff  bungee system that cushion that little  bit of movement you get right there it  saves your spine so so you can walk away  from this with having you know no IES  whatsoever but if you did not run that  setup it would be a different story and  then there's a fail safe as well which  is just empty water bottles that I taped  together and sat on and I ended up  popping I think three of them is that  standard practice or is that your idea  that's kind of standard practice  actually like you go into all you have  all this this technology cups and  plywood yeah I mean and then you go back  to some old school methods that work  that that have saved people for years  and years and years no flowers were  harmed no no flowers sh this those are  not real  flowers thanks for watching I think  there's something wrong with my remote  it's not working so I'm going to go fix  it go see the Fall Guy May 3rd see some  more amazing work from these two  incredible stun performers oh wow yeah  there you go man thanks man",

      "page_content": "hey GQ I'm Chris Stapleton and these are  my  [Music]  essentials all right for this essential  first let me go get  it this chair was the chair that was in  my breakfast area growing up there were  there were four of them originally and  they were kind of a yellow vinyl when I  was a kid my mother kind of recovered  this one in the late ' 80s I think and  it kind of traveled around with me um  kind of went to college with me or VAR  living situations with me but it's  always been with me it's been my guitar  chair that I kind of sit around and play  guitar in every time I go make a record  the chair comes with me and right now I  get to sit in the chair for a different  reason but that's the story of the  chair this is a 1964 Jazz Master this  was the first nice old guitar I ever got  and it was a gift from my wife when I  received it it it looked very uh  mint I kept it that way for a while and  then I started feeling bad it's a tool  to me and it's meant to be used and so I  I've used it over the years and it's  certainly in the room for everything  that I've ever recorded even if it's not  played on everything I've ever recorded  it's played on a lot of things that I've  recorded you can see over the years it  it turned very not meant just from use  but that's okay this is all Hest where  it's been a good tool and has served me  well generally I'm not playing an  electric guitar in a riding setting uh  unless I'm there in a studio with the  whole band the guitar that I would  choose to sit in a room with is about to  come  in  [Music]  this is a 1950  something Gibson LG2 it has a replaced  neck on it and replace tuners and body  probably Ed it as a canoe paddle there's  like mud in it and so many repaired  cracks that you probably can't count  them I bought this guitar very early in  my songwriting career and most songs  that I've written um have been on this  guitar these are the foundations of most  of the music that I've made in my  songwriting and record making career I  paid about $380 for this guitar it took  about $900 to make it work correctly but  it's earned its keep beyond that and I  don't know all the stories that made it  look like this but it's certainly been  with me for a lot of good ones I have a  friend of mine who talks about playing  guitar in the way that you have to kind  of throw your whole body into it when  you're in the moment of singing or  playing um if you're not putting all of  yourself into it then you're not going  to get that but I I try to do that at  all times but certainly there's moments  where you know know all right this is  not the one we're just working this out  that you're not doing that but when it's  go time uh whether it's a live show or  um recording something yeah you just go  there if you didn't get there all the  way that wasn't the one you  know the jeep that we're going to take a  look at is a 1979 Jeep chair key that my  wife purchased for me after my dad  passed away she caught me looking at it  online said hey let's get out of here we  flew Phoenix are Arizona and drove it  back uh to Nashville it was all original  at the time and had uh you know like  77,000 Mi on it and I warned her that we  would not make it all the way and we did  we did lose an alternator along the way  but since it made its way back home she  kind of regifted it to me as uh in a way  that she kind of hooked it up for some  guys at hendri racing to kind of redo  the whole thing so it's as modern as it  can be mechanically and every nut bolt  and screw on it is either refurbished or  new so it's a thing that I can get  inside and once again have lots of great  memories it's special to me in way that  I could never get rid of it and  hopefully never wreck in it in this Jeep  I wrote the song traveler my wife was  asleep in the passenger seat I was  driving and the sun was coming up over  the horizon I wrote the song while I was  driving we wind up stopping in Gallop  New Mexico that night and I had to you  know take the guitar inside and figure  out how to play it so that that was how  that song got written and ultimately  went up being the the title track of uh  debut album so the Jeep has significance  in in that  way if you're a chef or a knife  collector you know what this is It's a  knife rule this one belong to my dad and  where I grew up in Eastern Kentucky  knives would be given as a sign of  respect they were things that one man  would give to another man so my dad when  he passed away there were quite a few  knives I didn't really collect knives or  anything like that previous to that but  I had inherited some from my grandfather  and these are from my dad a lot of them  from my dad this one in particular I  know was his and I hold and I think of  them they're from various times periods  of time a lot of Case Knives them are  from the 40s up to the 60s 7s you hold  on to them you know this one was my  grandfather's um he was a knife  collector but my dad was not necessarily  and I think about them a lot I think  when I open these things up and touch  them I can feel connected to them in a  way that maybe I'm not otherwise so it  kind of got me when they passed away I  kind I kind of turned into I would I  would pick up knives and as I was  thinking about doing this I was thinking  about the sign of respecting and I  really started getting in my own head  about it thinking about well when I buy  a knife am I trying to buy self-respect  I don't really know maybe that's what  I'm doing I don't know but I but I I do  it to feel connected to my father and my  mother's father who had the all these  knives this is my grandfather's flag he  was a soldier in World War II he was  buried and this was the flag that was on  his coffin and they handed over to the  family at the end I have given the honor  of getting to keep this with me and  always kind of remember the things that  he had to do so we get to do the the  things that we get to do I keep this in  my office this stays in my office and uh  if I'm in my office riding it's sitting  right there by the wall and it's always  in the room he was a man with a 10th  grade education that wound up  engineering for a multinational cult  Corporation he was is a testament to  hard work and very very um particular in  the things that he did so all those  things you know inform some of what I do  I'm  sure this is a hat my hat that I've worn  for a long long time I had a different  one years ago that was similar my wife  gave it away to a fan at a club one  night she's like you can get another one  right and I was like well no not really  they don't don't make that anymore so I  I had to hunt for something similar this  one's better you know there was a reason  gave that one away I always kind of  loved crazy hats and the guys that wore  them the company that makes these hats  is a company called Charlie one horse  and this was made in the late '70s early  ' 80s and I found it a New Old Stock and  I've worn it nearly out there's not a  there's not a band in it anymore this  one's on slap legs really so hopefully  my career will last longer than this hat  will because it's very very fragile at  this point but the guys uh and and the  ladies and the crew have have dubbed it  precious so it has a name it's a hat  with a name mainly because it's fragile  so that's the Hat keeps the lights out  of your eyes once again it's utilitarian  but it's also decorative it's been with  me on everything that I've done and when  people think of what I do I think they  think of this hat probably as much as  they think of me my great grandmother  made this blanket she gave it to my dad  when he went away to college and it sat  around in chairs in my house growing up  if it was a cold night this was what you  pulled out I don't know when it would  have been made maybe the 60s but these  were all pieces of material that my  great-grandmother had saved from mending  things it got worn to the point where  the edges of it were kind of worn off  and my mother actually kind of repaired  some of it so it has that kind of touch  to it too if I was running out of a  burning building it's it's the thing  that I would grab in my house you know  so if I want a blanket this is the one I  want this is a pair of boots made for me  customed by the uh lucasi company I was  on a radio tour in El Paso before  traveler came out or anything like that  lucasi makes really really nice boots  they take you up to this kind of Willy  Wonka room when you do the factory tour  and they're like hey we'd like to make  you a pair of boots pick out anything  you want I think they were surprised  when I was like okay I just want this  kind of very plain pair of boots they  have much more expensive versions of  things I like no I I want something I'm  going to wear every day and that's what  I did with these for the longest time  these were my everyday Boot and I wore  these everywhere and did everything in  these boots I love things that have  genuine wear on them as well and so  there's a lot of that I look at these  boots and I think about things that  we've done a lot of those things  happened in these boots they're special  to me in that way I always have a a  Filson jacket running around with me  somewhere it's this kind of wax cot  material it's just kind of allp purpose  if it's raining if it's windy or you  just need a jacket it works out for that  so it's tough you can abuse it toss it  around if a budy guy was in a band with  it used to say things like you can get  your work done in it I don't know it's  just a nice utilitarian item and I have  a lot of respect for things that work  and this is the thing that works my  personal style is absolutely completely  utilitarian I wanted just to to uh  function as a as a garment it was a  philson jacket that I wore on the sing  of the national anthem for the Super  Bowl so it works in that setting as well  thank you for taking the time to uh  watch My Essentials and I hope maybe you  learned something about me that you  didn't know or if you didn't thanks for  joining us  anyway",

      "page_content": "all right Lock and Load you guys let's  do it you got you got notes oh come on  I'm talking to the greatest living  director I gotta you're supposed to be  talking well I also have some anecdotes  about the weather in case  [Music]  [Applause]  excellent hey come on everybody move on  out I feel whenever I'm on a set I'm  just like I'm not directing this you  could direct it let's get a crane let's  get  a first time I saw him was in um a Lucas  film I call me by your name yeah and so  you know and I a great admire of Luca  and I love the picture I always talk  about um performances but they aren't  really they're like behavioral where you  don't see the acting you know what I  mean yes and so um I connected there and  I saw Dune  you know which I enjoyed and I started  to see a sense of rage you know and then  they said they Chanel asked me to do  this spot for  Blue uh which you had already done I had  done years ago right yeah had the first  one they said they had this young  gentleman named Timothy shalamay and I  said ah that one I know and we had some  kind of a dinner and talk Etc we had a  plan for the I guess you call it a  commercial I don't know what it is it's  a little narrative I it's not  provocative of other commercials and  perfume commercials in a good way in a  good way I think it's somewhat different  than that and and so it's it's a story  anyway um but how to break it through  you know my latest film was over 3  hours this 60 seconds and it's so Mar  it's only only 60 seconds the thing  about 60 seconds is it's harder  condensed condensed and every frame  counts every frame you know I know we're  talking digital but there's still frames  in digital mhm but I mean one frame more  two frame that's the way we're editing  this thing add two frames take away a  frame you know ju to position of images  all the sort of thing so it's not an a  fcil way of working it's actually I find  these much more intense and it's a  they're  real um workouts more challenging yeah  more challenging The Narrative itself  was about the film actor and being on  the road and um one of the things we  referred to was the great uh short film  by Federico felini Toby damit Toby damit  yeah and I showed it to you and uh I  said let's capture some of that feeling  you know that's one of my favorite  interactions with you is you said you've  seen Toby damn it right and I thought  this felini this your felini short no I  haven't but I quickly quickly got onto  it with that as an inspiration we we uh  came up with the story somehow but  developed into a kind of story and how  that happened I'm not quite sure no but  it's I I'm so grateful I felt but I love  I felt so honored that you brought uh  because um this didn't feel like a  commercial and I guess the fear as an  actor that's why I was so excited that  you agreed to do it too is that you know  you don't have to feel you know whatever  like a product I know this was a total  dream total short film what I walked  away with the most we haven't even  gotten a chance to speak about it but I  was just so shocked about how  unprecidented detail it was just so  fascinating when filmmakers started out  and I broke a lot of young filmmakers  there enormously precious and maybe  plotting sometimes here we were just  like going you know well it was planned  beforehand yeah to fly like that well  not to fly like that but I was glad it  flew yeah but no the the shots were  designed or at least the I like to call  it like a philosophy of a shot should  this be a moving shot at all right or  should it be static and if it's static  what the hell size are you in the frame  right is it from the waist up so that  was all basically plan yeah I mean I  mean then when you get into the like  they're looking out the window when you  see the uh uh the billboard the  billboard I know you're going to walk  towards camera but where do you stop um  I didn't know there was a shot list  basically I have it myself do you always  work like that basically or not well  back fures yes back in uh when I started  doing uh my first films I would draw  everything wow that sounds time  intensive yeah well I was by myself  anyway I was always by myself nobody  wanted to be that's that's another story  another I was always in a room by myself  taxi driver was literally there  literally across the street designed the  whole picture and Drew all the pictures  right across the street at the St  Bridges hotel in that out that window I  spent a lot of time doing that because  first of all I like the idea of how to  tell a story with pictures right but it  also because it was so low budget MH I  had to really have a plan have a plan so  that it could be changed had you had an  experience where you didn't have a plan  that ined yes later on I tried I tried  another film but it I seemed to work  better with a plan really do it's like  showing up memorized or showing up un  memorized  yes yes yes probably deal with a lot of  people that are un memorized no it's  true but you memorize is one thing  knowing it's another right yeah as long  as you know exactly as long as you know  it you know you could start fooling  around with stuff and but I tried a  different experiment once and it didn't  work for me but over the years the  drawings became notes and little  drawings in the margins of the of the  script or let's say in good fellow  actually was put into the script how  silic shot shot lists or or that the  actors would go off of in some way or no  no as long as I had actors who could if  I had a specific shot I wanted to get  which was complicated as long as he or  she would be able to behave uh  unencumbered in the frame you know if  I'm asking them to look backwards and  walk forwards at the same time and that  I found that to be a problem then I may  have adjusted the shot you right right  depend on what's more important uh their  faces and what they're doing or this  particular move to the left or right but  it's amazing and after thr hours and  Good Fellas there's shots sometimes that  pushing rapidly on someone and they're  doing something very natural  behaviorally obviously dairo is one of  the greatest ever but you'll be a  camera's flying at him and he's like  picking his teeth or something he's not  Disturbed and uh that's why I was so  seriously inspired working with you is  that it was so  Moon you saw I mean in certain cases you  just hold the camera don't move right  now I was shocked with Killers too it's  very engaging I'm shocked only because  of the the runtime but it's your grip  the entire time that was our big  gambling it's amazing U pacing wise all  those characters feel out of that era  Leo most of all I know I tell you well  you know what it's like you're in a  place like that you learn to live in it  yeah and you become part of it yeah and  I mean yeah it was a long shoot but a  lot of my pictures has lately have been  long right that's why I wanted to do  this I wanted to change the style right  away I had to freshen up right right I  had to change it doesn't mean go faster  I had to think differently you know to  force myself to think differently no I  loved it was lean it was muscular and it  was like way more running gun than I  ever would have thought I wanted to be  free and open yeah it was constructed as  I say and designed right but yeah but  there's room to play yeah that's what I  loved um from my perspective sometimes  Direction can be really explicit and  then when something's really explicit  it's quite hard to get to I can't  imagine how how you do it yeah because  you kind of lose your mind you know but  when and I felt you nudging which is  really the best because if you're  getting sort of gently and then if you  don't get there I felt that too if I was  like it's not going to work [ __ ] it  we're going to go do something else do  something else well because but you see  the nature of this spot lent itself to  that because of um uh the spontaneity of  the show let's say or the backstage  chaos you know look being specific and  blocking specifically it's another way  of artistic expression right you know  and there are times when I have to do it  right you know but this particular story  didn't need that yes you know I I think  we we hit we hit the pacing right  getting in the the van was hard when we  hit you with the camera but that was  used that's when I was laughing the  first time I saw this SP CU I thought  wow this is again  unprecipitated you look up you know it  kind of indicates the audience that what  you're going to see for the next minute  minute and a half whatever it is is  something very different and special I  shot a movie in New York 7 years ago on  the streets whatever and it was so  wonderful to to rap and then walk home  feels more like a creative exercise I  guess well the city has the and they  always use the cliche of the energy but  it does have the energy right it simply  does because everybody's on top of each  other right I mean look at it all the  buildings on top of each it's different  from La La is spread out you get the car  back in 1971 when when I learned to  drive I had to learn to drive out there  it was wonderful it's made for cars yeah  you know and you just turn the music up  your uh your Edge rots out there  though yeah it tended to but luckily I  was able to do films like taxi driver  and then right mainly because they saw  main streets and they wanted to Nero and  myself together on that film but it was  a different New York oh that was the New  York of um you know Ford to City Dro  Dead We shot in the summer of 76 it was  the most apparently the most violent no  well violent yes but you see for me  violence here is always the same I I I I  grew up here I I'm always walking in the  street a certain way or I know not yeah  he was checking your shoulder so the  thing about it is now I I I just know I  could see a person coming down that may  not because I grew up downtown on the in  a rough area L side when the bowy was  the bowy and it was pretty scary growing  up as a kid but um what had happened was  that the city was going to go bankrupt  and they asked the uh from my long story  short they asked for federal the bronc  is on fire Insurance scheme yeah yeah it  was a buildings were collapsing that was  that famous building that collapsed uh  that we put in vinyl it was uh apparent  the lowest e that the city has ever been  in was then was that mid when we were sh  perfect cinematic background yeah but  for me it was normal right I was used to  that I grew up in Hell's Kitchen um and  uh Hell's Kitchen changed a lot from  when I was growing up cuz when I was  growing up it was still a little bit on  the edge in the Port Authority Bus  Terminal and that the port Authority's  kept its Edge by Nature I guess yeah it  has I mean the neighborhood is much  dressed up come up a bit but the Port  Authority was I used to use that a lot I  was living in New Jersey actually been  in the mid-60s it was very cheap to live  in Union City or Jersey City and I  coming in and out of that Port Authority  Bus Terminal what I saw in there yeah in  the' 60s my God it was horrifying right  the only places I think probably in  Alphabet City still has a sense of uh  the old tenaments that I grew up in  that's what was weird working on this  commercial too is is uh it's not tropes  but so much of the iconicism of New York  has stemmed from your work so it's  bizarre to all of a sudden be you know  well the only thing is like when we when  you're down in the uh in the street in  SoHo that you're walking along at the  end of the uh when I was growing up that  street is where you went to steal hubc  caps and now it's uh and also other  things yeah so I I got that I stole the  H and I was with guys you know kids now  it's like being in um Province toown  Connecticut I guess I never was there  but it's fancy as hell yeah yeah I love  in Taxi Driver haven't just watched it  again I feel like you see so many things  about moody or people on the edge  watching it again the opening shots are  like super beautiful and Serene and the  music's playing and it's not lecturing  the movie is not lecturing you and  telling no I just saw the city that way  all the time one of my favorite things  in the city is the steam coming up out  of the street M and so I had to have the  car go through the steam that opening  shine yeah yeah I had to and I was done  on 22nd Street somewhere late at night  that was criticized at one point by  certain snobby critics saying and that's  the level of the metaphor of the film  film hell you know cab is coming from  hell I said no that's New York it's it's  the steam in the streets it is what it  is and when you see things come through  that steam that way you could think of  if you want you could think of The  Inferno you could think of paradise  right you don't know right you know um  it's a beauty of the city late at night  that way when you just pipes of smoke  coming up all the way up second and  third Avenue oh man yeah absolutely  beautiful and the red lights the tail  lights of the cars it was always raining  too that that summer you guys got  it was always raining finally we were  waiting for the rain and we started to  go 2 or 3 days over schedule and they  were really mad at us the studio was  screaming and I got in a lot of trouble  because I'm going to pull the plug on  the picture and so I said I we're  shooting in the ring so it's not going  to  match we'll have to figure out how to  well we better shoot fast then now yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah get it done get it  done I still go back to basics you know  right normal lens long lens wide angle  lens right and then from there you could  go infinite right you know and so uh  movement or no movement movement of the  frame or movement of the camera in the  frame because a pan is different from a  track right right so I stay with those  Basics and then if there are new things  that that could be implemented in there  using focal length in a certain way but  I do find that um after all these years  uh and with all the new technology there  are more choices and it's kind of good  way except that more than two3 of those  choices you don't need to make right cuz  end up wasting time or something it's  wasting time yeah so it always goes down  to the basic the basic as an actor and  as a director what do you want to say  right and what's in the way something's  in the way what the hell is it is it  technology or is somebody you know in  front of you and you're trying to do  something and they're distracting you  it's it's that it's that simple right  and now with there's a few filmmakers  that have a command of both right yeah  yeah it's not get sucked into just The  Cutting Edge well I think a lot lot of  those filmmakers are recent in because  they they grew up with the technology I  did not it's another generation yeah  it's going to be interesting what you  guys do well that's why I'm and I don't  want to be cynical and I I don't want to  take myself out of being a member of my  generation as I have in the past but um  I just think uh boredom is a good thing  and the way I was intensely bored  growing up and had to read books or if I  could get my hands on a movie at my  grandma's house you cherish that movie  and with too much information too much  access you know what I mean you can't  you're not going to well was a similar  what you're talking about boredom in a  sense because of um in my case when I  was 3 years old 1945 I contracted asthma  and my parents working class they were  not they didn't have books in the house  and that sort of thing they would just  take me to the movies a lot or let me  eventually go by myself to the movies  and I had this little tiny area in the  apartment before everybody came back  from work wow then I to learn how to  read novels and this priest was a  interesting guy father prip was the one  who gave us Graham green and James Joyce  and that sort of about for 13 or 14  right and it started to read that was a  whole issue right you know but I think  uh it was peace meal in some way yeah  yeah but what happens is that he old  take the horse to water you know and if  the horse  drinks you know so that I had had a  couple of people who were doing that for  me and we were sustaining ourselves we  were continuing we took advantage of  those uh suggestions and guidance and it  wasn't always friendly these were tough  guys but they weren't telling you what  to think or what was good they were kind  of giving you the keys in some way  giving you a basis of morality too right  and somebody pointed out said like in  killers of the flower moon or number  number of the films I made where the  level of corruption is so deep because  it's not the the society is not rooted  in in Morality or any kind of  spirituality that's what human nature  might be that without that guidance or  without that even  dialogue uh between people about  morality and spirituality becomes it  becomes pure corruption right I mean if  I you know in the the movie it because  the Native Americans don't understand  the value of money if I you know charge  you a dollar for this glass of water  they pay it and then they realize you  realize they don't really understand  paper money or anything like that  they're rich but they don't know why um  and they don't know they don't know what  money is so when they come in again I'm  going to say it's $10 and they pay it  right so I'm going to say next time $25  I'll keep 15 meantime we're friends we  take care of each other and just like  you know you got the money anyway I  don't I have to work for the money  you're not I mean but that's an  interesting moral issue MH if it's only  a dollar charge a dollar and so that's  the interesting thing about how we could  become complicit in um Al absolutely  genocide yeah and a genocide not told  about really I I wasn't educated on it  but the movie is still very spiritual  though like a almost all your it is I  think it is I think it is a spiritual  core to it it's in how corruption just  uh infiltrates every aspect of your life  and you could learn to live with it  because you don't react against it you  don't speak up that's what's so great  about the Leo character and it you know  without giving anything away this guy's  a complicated figure to say the least  but it's handled so delicately you don't  feel that you're taking them uh you know  you're not instructing the viewer how to  feel either way no no no no no no not at  all not at all like uh in the case of uh  Wolf of Wall Street for example I only  learned the other day from uh an  interviewer who said you're not aware of  the war of Wolf of Wall Street I said  what are you talking about said well  there was a big screening at paramont  the picture and the for the critics in  New York apparently I was told this  there were two camps one camp that love  the picture in the other camp that was  Furious saying I didn't take a moral  stand on Jordan Belford and one of the  critics from the other group that liked  the picture said do you really need  Martin SC sayi to tell you that that's  wrong right that's well said it's well  said you really need him to tell you  that drunk well said he knows a  drunk is that moralistic attitude bore  you a little bit now or no well it's  beyond boring I think you know it's  always been around I mean well because  American's a Puritan country well it  says it is MH right well that's what's  confusing to me as a young person is but  there's a difference there's a  difference between religion and  spirituality okay and religion could  could taken the taken the wrong way  could become something that is  restricting  and becomes intolerable and becomes  judgmental judgmental key word there  yeah yeah so you have a big problem good  example is Killers the flower Moon yeah  there were all Europeans who were  Protestants right you know I'm not  condemning Protestants I'm just saying  that was the um the moral code they had  a morality uh you know when a guy like  Bill hail played by dairo who says I  love these oage people and he's killing  them but he does love them  now what is that it's fantastic because  you don't feel them there's no music cue  that made that says this guy's evil you  know no it's it's he's just going to do  what he's going to do but that that's  the the thing I think uh ultimately  about concentration for younger people  and taking the time not just to make a  movie to become famous that's good too  if you can yeah but but I think  ultimately if you have something to say  if you're really burning and not just  the party line yes exactly because the  most important things are things that  are new and fresh point away forward  point you to how people are feeling it's  harder to no now there's great there's  less mainstreaming of things now I think  things are a little more I was going to  say the other night we were at this big  event I that people were talking about  that the news is uh different now and  this and I said look back when I was  growing up there was CBS NBC ABC it's  gone right I said in effect the  mainstream is going does that shock you  having been so repr representative of  your generation to feel now like what  the hell am I looking at kind of thing  or no um but you're so young in spirit I  mean that I'm not just saying that smoke  than no no that that's nice but I I I  like keeping that youth and like keeping  an open mind but an open mind means less  restrictions and these days um for good  reason and for good intent there is a  great deal of a closing of the Mind  Right kill Killers walks that line  incredibly because tells us story of a  moral Injustice basic more than a moral  Injustice a human Injustice but you  still have characters that are  wonderfully complicated and yeah yeah  and that's that's that's hard to achieve  well because because there isn't such it  isn't as simple as suddenly you go into  a world it's all morally injust and  everybody's very serious and you they're  all villains no it's the guy next to you  it's you even Catholicism was confession  you have to examination of conscience or  ma it was Ma self-criticism you know  what I mean right but not to be afraid  to to to to criticize yourself right um  and don't come don't become cowed by  what other people think right and what  they want you to think I should say  right do you feel like the story around  your life and your work you know uh  impacted the kind of movies you were  making I don't know the story of my life  was I guess Round Up in the movies the  mid '70s that was a little rough period  pretty rough period till about 78 7678  were pretty tough and came out of it at  the end of 78 mhm I just embraced myself  from where I came from and did this film  that janir really wanted me to make over  the years but I had resisted and that  was Raging Bull I think I read that you  hadn't wanted to do it at first well for  many different reasons he saw it sooner  than I did he knew it was me he knew it  was in me the Jak Lama of character that  we were making and so then I felt  comfortable and I realized oh I know you  didn't see at first you no I was blind  because you thought you didn't relate to  it or uh it was first of all we hadn't  we hadn't really Consolidated the script  like Mar it's a huge story yeah and the  last 30 minutes or a different movie in  an amazing way yeah but there were  different things the the relationship  with dairo was changing too cuz of his  stardom yeah and and other things do you  want to work again with with him you  know what I'm saying I had to think  about that well some of the best  collaborations happen with you know yeah  yeah yeah but we went through that  period and we came out the other side  and was Raging Bull right there you go  so then we did it again and K comedy  then I wanted to go off into Last  Temptation Of Christ to other films that  I want to gangs in New York things like  that and uh ultimately when I say  embraced where I came from Raging Bull  was uh you know it's the' 70s and where  I came from people were still alive mhm  my parents were still living down in the  tenament MH um a lot of the stories I  was putting in my movies had elements of  Truth in them mhm a lot of people down  there were still alive names you  couldn't mention so yes you're there's a  sensitivity around these so I you know I  was in LA I had long hair I had cowboy  clothes I love I saw picture you at the  Film Festival recently and I I something  already I met yeah yeah so so no what  happened I had to grow the beard because  I looked so young everybody was laughing  you know they thought it was 12 years I  said no no okay so I grew a beard but  what I'm getting at is that uh I  couldn't really talk too much or Embrace  too much my background but by the time I  had did raing B said the hell with it  right and I went back and my mother and  father in the film and we just started  using your mom she in it y was it simp  like a like simply a respectful fear or  more than that it was a caution it was  caution yes yes no no a lot of people  were still alive yeah there before the  Little Italy became the Little Italy  that it is now right it was a closed  Society right no names mentioned ever  right it's nice when you come back with  the director there a there's a dialogue  there's a rapport also on the acting  side you feel like oh this guy this  person really likes me CU I'm I'm back  again yeah exactly me out yeah exactly  it gives you confidence but you've done  that I mean legendarily with dairo and  DiCaprio yeah and we'll do Chanel  commercials every three yes exactly no  but with them though it's a different  thing because dairo knew me from low E  side when we were 16 years old so he  knew the people I grew up with right  still does uh so a few of them left he  was on with another group uh up on  kenmir street we were on uh Prince and  and hon okay Prince and hon Street  Elizabeth M mulber every now and then we  met in these after hour bars late at  night respectful and always very very  nice to each other some of the guys he  was with were I didn't like I miss might  I'm talk yeah myself and a couple of my  friends we the stay guys stay was he  already acting I couldn't tell I don't  think so I lost track of him is what  happened and because Brian dep had been  working with dairo and high mom wow and  so they said you got to meet him and and  after the dinner was over we were  sitting in another room and and he  looked at me he says uh you used to hang  out with ctie right and Joe  morale and you're with the remember ALB  eyes I said yeah he said I'm Bobby I  said Bobby you mean Bobby from K he says  yeah wow I said him realize and that's  how we came back together linked my God  and now you live five blocks from each  other or whatever I don't know he seems  to be around the corner yeah you see I  can't tell in between rols he doesn't  look he looks Anonymous I have no idea  who he is he could be right next to me  he's at B&B Bagels on the line behind  you something yeah yeah you don't know  what's going on I mean one night we had  dinner with Michael Powell the Great  British director uh we preparing for  Raging Bull he wanted to ask him  questions about gaining weight there's a  sequence that Powell does in this film  Kel blimp I said well we'll meet Bob  tonight at dinner and there was a  apartment I had on uh 57 Street and  we're up there eating and Bob's next to  him and everything's fine and after the  main course before dessert he said I  understand dairo will be coming tonight  I said he's right next to you oh my God  he had realized the whole time because  he's very quiet and anous Anonymous you  feel feel it in his work you feel  someone that's not vain basically I know  that's the key because Hey listen if the  shot plays best on my back and on  somebody else's face play it right  whereas other actors they need highlight  they need to look a certain way not  talking about me by the way he didn't  need any he didn't any um and with Leo  Leo just interesting 30 30-year  difference but he has similar  sensibility mhm and a curiosity mhm  curiosity is the key thing you know man  is it ever that's the biggest thing  there's a Bob Dylan quote from  Chronicles his book I might butcher it a  little bit but he says if your ability  to uh Inspire be curious or observed is  compromised in any way then your  creativity is compromised that's right  yeah and that's the danger of today too  yeah because what there's an answer to  everything yeah an answer and there's a  understandably a sensitivity mhm you  know which has to be balanced with art  somehow mhm because uh the art be free I  just read for taxi driver that there was  some like all the directors had come up  with some rule or something I'm going to  butcher this too but that to to be  moralistic to not put violence in movies  or something yeah I still got that I got  that oh my God I was I was shunned for  Good  Fellas now why Shun in certain Italian  restaurants it wouldn't let me in would  do you feel like over the years that  perception changed no it I mean look  violence is that in the ancient Greeks  violence usually took place  offstage and it was described  right messenger comes in says you should  see what happened right right right you  should see what they did to to you know  helus he was up there they they tore him  apart in the baket oh my God you know  also helps the fight budget and the St  budget yeah yeah but um but it was just  as scary and just as disturbing um  highly stylized I guess I've had this  kind of question about violence going  all the way back to main streets MH you  know but I grew up in a place that was  you know violence was form of expression  right and communication yeah yeah and it  was serious there was a difference  between a a friendly slap and a slap mhm  and that was up to you to determine you  could see that in Good Fellas when he  says you think I'm funny was that  scripted no yeah that wasn't scripted no  something something happened to Joe in  his  life and he told me and he said he got  himself out of it he got him by saying  he was on the yeah you're screwing with  me you're screwing with me guy said I  had you there you bastard I had you you  know and I said that's the story it  wasn't even the script we put it in that  reminds me when I was in Middle School  on 1008 in Amsterdam and uh I saw one of  my good friends Jordan the week before  someone said to him he got basically a  tussle in an argument with a guy and uh  he said to the guy you're so tough punch  me in the face and he leaned in and the  other guy was terrified he backed down  so you know a week later I was getting  hassled by some kids I leaned into the  guy said you so tough punch me in the  face and I got one of the few times in  my life I got punched so bad really  hurts that really one of the few times  in my life I got really rocked in the  face  it's good lesson though yeah no I I I I  found luckily I had the asthma because  they leave me alone they were some of  the toughest guys they would P fool you  around and get mad at you and then say  ah it's all right the kid's sick and  they would take yeah come here and they  would took care of me oh I love in the  uh in the in the spot when you say well  I'd be kinder to myself wait I haven't  seen I don't remember that this must be  the new version yeah we put that anyway  thank you thanks for let me chat like  this  thanks can we settle we're just getting  the last line right here and we're we're  ending hey you guys settled or what it  can't be that  bad are you guys just trying to get he's  good what are you  talking is that one a big deal this  kid sorry guys this be take two let's  see how sincere this is thanks again

      "page_content": "one of my everyday essentials is my  security guard Kevin come say hi to the  people does they look happy hi GQ I'm Ed  Sheran and these are my  [Music]  essentials Kevin has spent pretty much  every day of my life with me since 2015  he was there on the birth of both of my  children he was on my honeymoon yeah  we're we're best friends  and you know it's a deterrent people see  him and they go okay maybe I won't robed  what's the craziest story that comes to  mind out of the last 8 years none I can  say you it's the strong silent type I've  never seen Kevin in an altercation and I  think that's what makes Kev a good  security guard he gets me out of the  danger before it's even presented itself  he's not the only one as well he's got  he's got a few few  mates hey few of us  yeah so this is another essential this  is tingly Ted's hot sauce I did a TV  commercial for Hines ketchup cuz I like  Hines and I got in contact with them and  said I've got a commercial idea for you  if you want to do it together and then  they asked should we do another  commercial for Hines ketchup and I said  I'd actually want to create my own sauce  I had this idea for tingly Ted a while  ago I find some hot sauce a bit too  runny and watery not fit for purpose so  I wanted to create something that was  totally fit for the purpose that I I use  hot sauce on like every everything I'm a  spice addict but I wanted something with  the taste that I like and a consistency  and something you can cook with as well  so this I mean I go through bottles and  bottles and bottles of this every single  week I'd have it on breakfast lunch  Burgers nuggets I'd cook fajitas with it  cook pasta cook curries there's two  flavors out of the moment but we're  bringing out a uh I like to call it the  hoop hurter and that will be coming out  very soon and anyone that really really  likes their Rings stinged then you  know next essential is uh Apple TV  I travel a lot and I find myself sat in  a hotel room on my own a lot and this  has all the streaming platforms on and I  can basically wherever I am in the world  if I've got like you know an hour to  kill I can go on choose a TV show choose  a movie and and watch that I mean this  this comes with me everywhere I put it  in my dressing room I put it in my hotel  room I have it at home it's yeah a very  useful bit of Kit being on Game of  Thrones was it was cool it was it was  very cold and they gave me thermal  everything thing and I was like ah it's  Northern irand it's not going to be that  cold and it was like I really regretted  the decision not wearing thermals the  reaction to me being on Game of Thrones  was obviously not as glowing uh and  positive as how I felt about it but what  I would say to people is if someone  asked you to be on your favorite show  you'd say yes  too so one of my essentials on the road  is having a watch like this which is a  uh it's just a regular G-Shock this is I  did a subtract Edition I love collecting  watches but I think having a watch that  you can wear anywhere and everywhere and  you can swim with this you can run with  this you could you could go to a club  with this you can go but I wouldn't have  to have a security guard and I always  have this in my bag to wear at all times  I love it so this watch uh was made for  me for the mathematics tour and it's a a  oneof one all the mathematics colors and  symbols on it's basically a stage watch  for me every weekend for the uh for the  stadium shows but I basically bring both  of these on the road this would be the  everyday wear and this would be the  stage  watch  another one of my essentials would be V5  hair wax this is texturizing gum I've  used this not this particular one  although this is about 11 years old this  it's it's empty um yeah I've used this  probably since I was about 13 uh I name  dropped V5 in my song you need me I  don't need you and they sent me a  lifetime supply that say Edge Shar and's  texturizing gum and when they said  lifetime supply I've still got a lot of  the supply and you know I'm barely  halfway through it so it is definitely a  lifetime supply yeah I've only ever used  this on my hair and yeah I've run out  which is why I'm wearing a hat today but  yeah I know gel not for me matte clay  not for me hairspray not for me it's all  about the texturizing gum but then I  don't know if anyone's going to watch  this video and go oh I'd love to have  hair that looks like EDS but if you  [Laughter]  do so this is another one of my  essentials this is Paca raban million  just a a spray this the same as the the  texturizing G I've used this since I was  about 16 the only reason I got it was  cuz it looked  fancy and I was 16 and you know I think  the one I got was like this big as well  it was like I got it with a voucher for  Christmas but I've used it ever since  and I guess like when you find your  smell it's your smell I really think  like I I meet a lot of people throughout  the day and you know I think people look  at me and they think he looks like he  doesn't smell nice  and I try to so this is is I think the  thing that I use the most in the day  this is my iPad Mini yeah I moved off a  phone in 2015 and I didn't have any form  of communication for about a year I was  just like off everything and then when I  got back to work for divid I was like  I'm going to move back on to email  everyone expects a reply to a text  instantly with email for some reason  culturally everyone's like yeah yeah  yeah you can reply to that tomorrow and  it's not like you're just spending your  whole time on your phone and I have  three folders I have personal work and  Urgent for me to compartmentalize  conversations rather than just having  chaos it's helpful for brain space  especially with a young family I  actually write every single one of my  songs on here as well so on notes all of  my lyrics are written on here on uh  voice notes as well all of my ideas for  like guitar riffs and stuff like that so  this is a an important bit of Kit and  it's really smashed up like really  really smashed up I made a load of songs  with Jay Balvin and he was so offended  that my iPad was so smashed up and I was  using like it was literally like holes  in it that he like bought me a new one  then and there and yeah that's this one  and it's smashed up so Jose thank you  but it's it's the same as the one you  replaced these uh headphones I have like  seven pairs of these cuz I keep losing  them and then and then finding them  again so these are don't know these  aren't the pros yeah I think headphones  are essential for anything I mean for me  checking mixes of my music I video call  my kids and stuff like that so to be  able to be in private basically in  public I think is quite important the  three artists I would listen to for the  rest of my life I think the Beatles I'm  going to choose artists that have a wide  wide wide catalog cuz there are some  artists that are my favorite artists but  have like two or three albums and if it  was for rest of my life I'd want to have  a wide catalog I would say the Beatles I  would say Eminem and for  [Music]  events so another one of my essentials  would be a corkscrew bottle opener for  uh wine I stopped drinking Spirits a  couple of years ago and I've kind of uh  channeled all my energy into into red  wine yeah I've been caught out a few  times where you're in a situation where  you have a bottle of wine and you want  to drink it and I've learned how to push  a cork down now and basically open a  bottle without a cork screw but  sometimes especially wearing a white  t-shirt it's dangerous you push it in  and goes all over you so I would say a  cork screw is essential in my bag I  would say a bottle of wine as well but I  think that it that's not essential to  bring with you at all times cuz you  could pretty much anywhere in the world  you can find a bottle of  wine this is the only thing that I carry  on my person apart from a watch I have a  wallet I used to carry a wallet with  cash in it and yeah cash just seems to  be a thing of the past now so I just  literally have a credit card I feel like  I could be caught out in any situation  and be fine with even if I didn't have a  watch just a credit card I think you  could get yourself out of a few binds  Just One credit card yeah and I've got a  card that someone gave me for counseling  custody and  meditation that it sometimes has cards  in there you know that people give me  and I forget to take out but yeah I  should probably take that one out I've  watched so many of these and it's nice  to be the one being watched today i'  I've always wondered about what my  essentials would be and I really wanted  to pick things that were actually in my  bag and yeah thank you so much for  having me and hope you enjoy the next  person whoever it  is",

      "page_content": "put on the suit let's go a few  rounds who do you think is stronger  Captain America or Iron Man well I'm  biased um so I'm I'm going to say cap  but who's smarter who's richer uh I I'll  give those to  [Music]  Tony Fantastic  [Music]  Four now picture  that but everywhere I wasn't a big comic  book reader I mean I've read a lot now  but but at the time aside from like the  ' 80s and early '90s Batman Superman  things like that that new wave of  superhero films the Spider-Man the X-Men  they had just begun so it was really  exciting you know marvel hadn't even  kind of taken back their name yet so it  was that film was at Fox it was one of  the bigger movies I had done up until  that point so I was ecstatic and it was  a fun role to play he was full of life  and he reacted the way I probably would  have reacted if I was given superpowers  I'm so close to Flying guys I can taste  it you can't fly yet Johnny can you put  that napkin out oh Jesus it was the  first time doing those big action e  stunts you know you show up on a set  that's two blocks long and these giant  cables and explosions and green screens  and it's you know the stuff you see in  the making ofs on other films you know  and it's kind of like wow I I make  movies this is great and just having a  good time with the cast we had a lot of  fun this was in the early 2000s this is  before social media I think everyone  probably had a Nokia flip phone you know  so it it still was a time where you know  in between takes everyone's not buried  in their phone you're conversing and you  know at night you're socializing and  yeah it's my early 20s it was a good  time Captain America  [Music]  you knew that Marvel had big plans that  the goal was to create this tapestry and  integrate these worlds in a way that  really hadn't been done prior and I knew  what the comic books offered me you know  just about the character would like most  Comics there's a number of different  writers who are writing for that  character and a number of different  storylines so you're not quite sure  which one they're going to follow yeah  it wasn't a whole lot about where the  character was going to end up it was  more about you know the burden of trying  to create this universe but that didn't  really fall in my lap that was other  people's responsibility and we had  Downey driving the [ __ ] you know what I  mean like he had already done so well  with Iron Man and it was such a  phenomenon that you you kind of felt  like okay this is we're off on the right  foot before we get  started does anyone want to get  out you want to see how the fans see him  you know what I mean anytime I've heard  about movies that are being made or  remade something that's dear to me you  realize how protective and possessive  you are over that role and you want to  make sure the person playing the  character respects that perspective and  isn't just like well you know I know  they know the character but this is my  time and I'm going to do my thing that's  stumbling right out of the gate so first  step try to understand why other people  like them and honor it as best you can  [Music]  Avengers Assemble there's a lot of fun  moments in endgame because it's a lot of  moments that are servicing the fandom  but for a lot of those prep Montage  where we're about to go back and get the  Stones it's kind of some of the original  people and we just got to be in this  room for weeks I obviously really like  the scene where I pick up mner for the  first time  [Music]  [Applause]  just all good most of the scenes in  endgame it just you're fully aware of  what you got to be a part of you're  really just kind of uh so grateful every  day and just trying to absorb it all you  know I think when you're in the middle  of it it's just always like there  another Marvel movie next year not that  you take it for granted but it just  doesn't resonate the same way when you  know wow we're rapping in a couple weeks  and I'm putting the shield down and  that's just uh it's been such a big part  of my life for a decade so most of  endgame was a really really lovely  experience how does it  feel like it's someone  else's it isn't that last day was you  know emotional it's like graduating  school I mean like you know the day is  coming and then it's all of a sudden  here and you feel like it went by way  too quick and I mean it's life-changing  my life is forever not the same my  family's life isn't you know what I mean  like the the ripple effect of signing up  for that role is kind of immeasurable  for me at least and it was a beautiful  time full of  gratitude Scott Pilgrim versus the world  you really don't know about the league  um the seven Evil xes coming to kill you  controlling the future of Ramona's love  life no oh well Hey listen man don't  worry about it really yeah let's go get  a beer that's great the pitch for Scott  pgrm was so strange but he kind of said  you know Lucas Lee is this movie star  but he really doesn't have much range  and he thinks he's great but he's  actually terrible and I think you'd be  perfect I said  [Laughter]  [Music]  okay they spent a lot a lot of time  trying to get me to look comfortable but  at the end of the day I'm still hanging  off of cables and had a rig where my  shoe was connected to the skateboard so  when I try and Ollie it comes up with me  so I mean you know but you dive in CU  you're in this big warehouse and Mary's  in the corner working with swords and  Mike and Jason are over there doing this  big action sequence so you know you're  just happy to be a part of it that's  probably the most fun I've had on a  movie again early in my career 20s but a  big cast of people in the same place I  want to have is adopted babies the cast  was very  connected  hey hey I'm not  oh looks like you're seeing  double he's good right leaving was  heartbreaking it truly was like the  first time I was like I mean I can just  hang out guys if you need me to you know  it's you don't want to miss a beat  another film where there was a rehearsal  period that was more physical based you  know a lot of people had action  sequences I had to learn how to  skateboard but the rehearsal was so fun  then you leave and come back a month  later to do your bit and you just have  such horrible fomo you just you know  what you guys been doing have you been  having fun send me pictures yeah to this  day that email chain is still very  active when I first saw it after they  finished the edit before it had been  released I saw it and was just like this  movie is going to be huge you know and  then oddly it kind of came and went the  moons that have to line for a movie to  not just be good but find success is is  is a lot but it's nice to know that that  one continues to find new audiences and  it's kind of created a little bit of  like a cult following that's why we're  doing this animated series and I've just  never been a part of something where all  Edgar had to do was say hey you guys  want to do this and it was a race to  jump in everyone yes of course of course  no no no brainer so yeah it's it's  little  family not enough team  movie at that point I would have taken  any movie but yeah to to be able to  Spook some of those films that I grew up  on was a treat oh my God it's  Jake hi stud hi Jake Jake I love what he  does with his eyebrows there was Ferris  ber elements my dad in the movie was was  Ferris is Dad you know just to be in any  way somewhat adjacent to Ferris ber was  pretty exciting at the time j's got  jie br's got a gun he's got a gun Jie's  got  a a comedy is more intimidating keeping  things fresh on a film set is the  biggest challenge drama you can always  find something to make it feel honest  comedy you know when you tell a joke or  you know you know the comedic Rhythm  that's coming it's very easy to get  stale you got to be really Nimble and  just intrinsically funny which I don't  know that that I am so it's uh it's an  uphill  battle knives  out stop stop stop stop you  dyd Ransom call me Ransom it's my middle  name I mean I love a murder mystery I  love an ensemble I love the major I mean  that cast is just phenomenal and Ryan  Johnson again another director who  really knows what he wants and it was a  role that I felt confid in it it was an  intimidating role just because a lot of  the characters are colorful um and you  don't quite know how far to go and how  grounded do I make this and again you  let Ryan guide you but it was just a  dream job had a blast with a good lawyer  which I have I'll be out in no time and  then you'll see just how much hell I can  wreak on your life you vicious little  [ __ ]  oh that was a great scene I didn't love  getting the puke in my  [Music]  face what the  [ __ ] that means she's lying yeah man we  know I have such a love for Michael  shann and I just think he's the funniest  guy I don't think anyone realizes how  he's so dry and so sharp and he knows  he's funny too he'll make these like you  know kind of quiet side comments and  just have the littlest smirk on his face  face so then we were doing that scene  where he's shoving the cookies in my  face and just screaming how about some  more cookies you you want some more  cookies great hey maybe har left you a  cold glass of milk in his will [ __ ]  the calling me to not break he's just  he's very committed absolutely hilarious  so that that might be my favorite  scene snow Pierce  [Music]  [Applause]  when I first read the script I didn't  quite get it I was like so what's you  know whenever it's a world a movie  that's uh World building you know you're  creating a completely separate  environment there's just kind of a  conceit that you have to say Okay so  everyone just accepts this this is just  how it is no one's kind of outrage that  this is the structure that's just the  norm okay you kind of have to decide  what part of your brain do you spend  time wrapping your head around do you go  uh the intimate Road and just kind of  make it about the character do you try  and make it about what it took for that  Society to level into that place it's a  challenge but you get to watch Tilda  swinton's in the movie you get to watch  her approach to this Larger than Life  character precisely 74% of you shall  die my friend you suffer from the the  misplaced optimism of the doomed again  we had some good rehearsal on that  project as well and director bong is  such a Visionary when when when you're  working with someone that knows exactly  what they want even if it's not exactly  the way you saw it it breeds trust and  and that that as an actor that's the  most important thing to trust the  director otherwise you're playing  defense otherwise you're like all right  well this first take I'll do this just  so I can at least protect that then I'll  try this but I don't want to try that  because I don't know if they know how to  use that take and any take I give them  could be us against me and you know when  you have a director who is so convinced  of what their vision is that's when you  say great you say JUMP I'll say ho  [Music]  high we had those cars on gimbals these  little like you know they just do like a  subtle movement so a lot of boat legs at  the end of the day you kind of are  wobbly getting back to your hotel room  incredibly uh helpful the tangible  environment as opposed to Marvel where  you're talking to green screens and  imaginary aliens everything was you know  right there for you to touch and react  with  sunshine do I have to spell it out for  you we have a payload to deliver to the  heart of our nearest star we're  delivering that payload cuz that star is  dying and if it dies we di everything  dies so that is our mission there is  nothing literally nothing more important  than completing our mission he's very  aifi in a lot of ways but he's kind of  the engine he's kind of the moral  compass he prioritizes the mission first  at the cost of people's feelings in a  lot of ways he's very clean he believes  strongly in what he believes in for the  most part selfless you know and and  there's a mission and he's going to get  it done and I like that I like those  kind of roles we do not have enough  oxygen reserves to get us to our payload  delivery  point let alone to survive the return  Journey so cancel the tick or tape  parade I was well aware of Danny Bole I  mean he's a major Talent he really comes  from the theater world too so to that  end the approach was very rehearsal  based you know in my short career at  that point I certainly had never had a  film that had that much prep time the  whole cast got out there couple weeks  before Danny had us all live together in  these little apartments for a couple  weeks experienced loss of space we did  scuba lessons to experience  weightlessness he would rent out  theaters to watch these you know dos  Boot and all the right stuff just all  these movies to put us in the right  mindset we did tons of rehearsing and it  got to a point that by the time you were  filming you knew what you were doing so  much a film you show up for the first  day and you're meeting the actor for the  first time time you're reading the words  for the first time um that had very much  a a theater approach I think I was a  little spoiled actually as a  result  puncture so you're telling the jury the  reason my client is fired was because he  falsified his resume not because he went  above your head and reported that trucks  were not getting fixed and people were  dying as a result  correct say  yes yes that was my first time playing a  a real person um and he had passed away  a few years prior so you have a there's  a unique burden that comes with that we  met his family met his brother and you  know you just you get you get personal  stories and socially relevant topic  which I was excited to be a part of and  a really fun role a director uh the  Casten Brothers Mark kassen who is now  my producing partner and dear friend it  was a really exciting time very  creatively satisfying role but also a  really demanding one and that kind of  coincided right when I got the offer to  do Captain America you know and I had  been coming off of puncture and was just  so content um with that type of film  making and Captain America just felt  like a different universe and I just was  really unsure if that's the world I  wanted to drift into so that's that's  part of the reasons I kind of was so  wary and said no to Captain America a  couple times because of the experience I  had on puncture you know I just wasn't  sure which Avenue to take  um in retrospect you realize that  nothing's binary you can kind  of construct any sort of path you'd like  but at the time it just felt  overwhelming yeah well at least I have  the courage to lose for what's right  sometimes on big big movies there's a  100 Cooks in the kitchen every decision  is filtered through you know a billion  teams of people and working on puncture  just feels like a couple people with a  camera you have a much more intimate  Hands-On approach to these aspects and  it just feels maybe a little more  protected I mean I've been a part of  films where you do your job and then it  there's so many steps that's the nature  of film making and when you see the  final product you say wow that is not  what I thought this was going to be such  is the case with big big movies smaller  movies it almost feels like you can  guide them along a bit more because  there's just less people  involved pain  Hustlers I play Pete brener he's a drug  repap he's representative of of a  mentality that's pretty ubiquitous in  the field which is just like hey I'm  just doing my job just doing my job it's  not my fault I'm not the one writing the  prescriptions I'm not the one killing  people I'm just passing it from A to B  so it's kind of uh this Twisted  perspective that absolves anyone from  responsibility of this epidemic What  specifically drew me was Emily you know  her and I are friendly and and we've  been looking for something to do  together pretty keen on joining  regardless but the story ended up being  very time and important anytime you can  work with a certain caliber of people on  a project that's relevant and important  and moves the needle in Social ways you  jump on board I think there's different  motivating factors creative appetites  Drift from one thing to the next one  time you might just want something  that's a comedy something that's you  know a fun or or you know or a horror  suspense but sometimes you know you  might even stumble across an issue that  means something to you personally and  then actively go pursue a project that  reflects that issue it's a blessing and  and uh I'm I'm uh very creatively  satisfied and you know personally  satisfied that I that I get to do that  from time to time",

      "page_content": "it says uh dear Joe it's good to be  working with you again Martin Scorsese  that was my Martin's curse as invitation  what's up everybody this is Joseph  Sakura and this is gq's 10 things that I  cannot live without  [Music]  look at the color of my skin I'm  translucent sunscreen is very important  to me because like I always say I come  in the colors of the Polish flag white  and red I got one here for my rosacea I  got my New York favorite kiehls another  like Fancy Pants one that my wife has me  wear every now and again full body arms  everywhere but giving my SPF to make  sure they're on my face I wear them rain  or shine summer or winter I gotta have  sunscreen on at all times  [Music]  my next essential item is  a yoga mat I try to take one everywhere  I go it's just nice to have this I was  doing a movie with Dion Taylor called  fear that you should go check out and I  was doing jump squats in a hit class and  I broke my kneecap because I was doing  it on concrete and stone floor so now I  wisely after I healed bring my yoga mat  everywhere that I can because you need a  little bit of cushioning I love to do  yoga but I also love hit classes and I  have found you don't need a whole lot of  weight to get results you just need to  not eat as much as I want to and be  consistent  [Music]  people say you know Eat to Live don't  live tea I live to eat I don't care and  one of those items is jardner especially  hot Gardener now the GQ team is talented  and as wonderful as they are this is not  Chicago authentic jardner it might do in  a pinch I gotta tell you I put it on  everything put it on pasta I put on  pizza anything even slightly Italian I  put it on sandwiches I love an Italian  hero of course you have to put it on  Italian beef and I get my beef dip  that's kind of this wonderful Mash of  and uh jardner with the spicy oil and  made my mouth water just now let's check  it out I'm not I'm not opposed to  licking my fingers either we got a good  piece of cauliflower here too  cauliflower is good it's heavy on the um  on the pickling on the vinegar which you  don't want to be overpowered by the  vinegar this is super not Chicago that  it's super watery here and Chicago to  just be pure oil this ain't hitting  right but it's a decent try um this is  mild I'm already nervous oh my God no  oil just in water  bizarrely it's almost better because  without this spice it's like it's a  different animal pickled vegetable but  it's just um there's kind of a freshness  as you can tell there's a crunch to it  I'm going to give it a salad too and say  peace  okay for my next essential it's a bit of  a surprise it's actually a beautiful  hero sandwich for you no it is a very  special and dear thing to me from my  good friend the drama King the street  sweeper DJ casely he made this for me  with my graffiti name on it he put Dez  TMT which is a huge honor growing up  being a graffiti writer having that be  so much a part of my identity part of  the reality of my Urban experience Des  one is one of the prominent Graffiti  Writers of all time in history this is a  beautiful reminder of meeting one of  your Heroes and this is super special to  me I can't believe I'm getting choked up  I'm a little embarrassed he gave me a  lot of belief in myself and my claim  that maybe rap is something you do but  hip-hop is something you live my  playlist I'm all over the place but I'm  I love that Golden Era of hip-hop you  know Rakim is always on my my top five  Big L and Jr the damager and Big Daddy  Kane and I love still love Kumo D and I  love the war between Kumo D and LL and  you know it was kind of that Golden Era  of hip-hop that brought the brands like  you know Brand Nubian and uh jungle  brothers and tribe and just this  wonderfully inclusive era of hip-hop  that was respectful of everybody in some  capacity and it was about knowledge and  progression it felt good  [Music]  next essential item that I can't live  without it's my money clip money grip a  money clip is so much better than a  wallet for me because it's just you pop  it out you got all your bills here can't  go nowhere without a hundo this will buy  me a coffee and a sandwich in New York I  have a funny little Visa card that you  can get clothes on that my mother-in-law  gave me and I think it's got 50 bucks on  here and I still haven't spent it I'm  kind of a cash guy and then I have my  Chicago Ventra card it's the Chicago  version of this this is for the the L  train the CTA I didn't have these  forever because I was against them one  of my favorite possessions is my metro  card how do you get anywhere in New York  without a metro card when people are too  bougie to have a metro card I'm sorry  for you sitting in traffic and breathing  in those fumes when you be surrounded by  wonderful New Yorkers in a sea of  humanity and get wherever you need to go  in all of the five boroughs I like  tangible stuff  this lion the Leo this is one of my  essentials because it was a really  difficult time in my life I had recently  gotten stage fright here in New York on  Broadway and then I ended up doing a  play at Chicago Shakespeare cymbaline  Sean cross who played Imogen the lead in  the play and I played her Star-Crossed  lover posthumous Leonidas which  obviously Leonidas meaning the lion she  gave me this afterwards and it was a  long journey for both of us she's one of  the country's Premier Shakespearean  actresses Sean cross and I'm not she  gave me this afterwards because we  really came far in our friendship and  going through a Shakespeare play The  Bard's words are pretty difficult a lot  of the time and it was really an  accomplishment and the beginning to  getting over my stage fright which took  me about 10 years to get over and I'm  still getting over it I still have stage  fright but it was during the power show  where I felt the freedom again to play  and not to be quite distressed and have  fun in the moment and I'm eternally  grateful for that and this reminds me  that I'm eternally grateful and I can  conquer my fears a big bad lion ah  foreign  my next essential is a thank you card  from a very special director named  Martin Scorsese this is when I was doing  Boardwalk Empire I had just done a tiny  little role in Shutter Island and then I  got casting Boardwalk Empire and it's  also very special because on the same  day that I got this thank you card from  Martin Scorsese is the exact same day  when I first met  the woman who would become my wife so  very special it took me a long time I've  been acting 37 years because I was not  successful but consistently acting  mainly doing Theater in Chicago I never  really claimed being an actor it wasn't  until probably about 15 years ago that I  felt like you know I'm an actor and a  certain sense of of coming into my own  being the person that I was becoming and  owning it and Marty was incredible you  know I'm in Chicago and I'm too humble  I'm just happy to be here and stuff and  he's like no no you're here for a reason  stand up be proud put your chest out  what do you got there in the notebook  and I'm like oh I just wrote the  backstory for this character he goes  read me the whole thing so I ended up  reading Martin Scorsese three full  single line College ruled pages of my  backstory of my character it made me  feel really good and important and I'm  grateful super grateful to him and it's  kind of a that was kind of really a  starting point for  the rest of my career it says uh dear  Joe it's good to be working with you  again my name's Chris Easy that was my  Martin Scorsese invitation  [Music]  my next essential is the dog tags it  says James Barr which is the character  that I played in the Jack Reacher movie  Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher movie why are  these so important to me it was more  than just the character but it was the  relationship obviously I love Tom Cruise  I love to work with Tom again he's a  constant professional I can't say enough  nice things about Tom Cruise a super  nice guy always remembered my name  consummate professional and demanded  that you bring your A game and for all  of those things but I met one of my best  friends Jai Courtney I'm so grateful for  the friends that I've made in the  entertainment industry uh other actors  because it's I think it's harder than  you think there's such a weirdness in  this business competitiveness  judgmentalness jadedness so when you  find the good ones you want to keep them  close to play a pretty backwards awful  murderer James Barr and to walk away  with so many positive things is no small  feet  [Music]  not a lot I kept the bullet that Tommy  used the blank to kill Angela but it is  fun to look at I'm just like oh look at  this this is the one that is the one  that got her  [Music]  step on this journey art from the Sakura  family the first option I'm going to  show you it's a charcoal drawing that my  little niece did and I think she was six  years old when she did this and my wife  and I were just blown away Arwen you are  an incredible artist don't ever stop and  I have no idea what this means and I'm  wondering if it you know a six-year-old  or maybe she was eight but no older than  that knew what necessarily this means  either but it's like such a wonderful  reason to make art it's just to express  something I think everybody sees is love  and unity and Oneness part two is my  mom's painting of a sunset in New  Buffalo Michigan isn't that unbelievable  like every time I look at it I feel like  it's a window and I'm actually watching  the sunset my third thing is this box  that my brother made for me for  Christmas and I don't know which  Christmas you probably can't see but  there's a little Santa Claus on there  done with crayons and it says here Joe  I'm sorry for all the bad things I did I  keep this box every single place I've  ever lived I store different things in  here oh and here's look there's ET my  grandmother was an artist art was always  something that she did my mother is an  incredible artist and  um I'm okay  hey thanks for having me GQ I loved  sharing my 10 Essentials right now and  don't forget you gotta watch power book  4 Force September 1st not stops  [Music]",

old and I cannot fathom it yeah  all day I've just been like  nah  we brought you home from the hospital  last week right you learned to walk  yesterday how is this happening yeah  what are you what are you doing for the  big uh big birthday what are you getting  them uh he's ever well what are we  getting him yeah it's changed now like  it feels like yesterday it was like Paw  Patrol  and now it's like a very particular pair  of Jordans yeah vinyl records you know  that whole thing it's it's it's a big  change when I was 12 years old I still  wanted toys  no it's a toy it's a non-toy scenario  now and then and then there's a party  cool he's got he's going to see scissor  tonight that's how cool he is  [Applause]  imagine that imagine your 12th birthday  go to see scissor at The Forum  my my actual first concert I think I was  15 and it was Weird Al Yankovic at the  Oregon State Fair well that tracks yeah  that tracks yeah I stopped having  birthday parties when I was nine why  yeah because I just wanted  we didn't have like a lot of money and I  just wanted to go to the theater so my  mum and dad were like look theater  tickets are expensive so that will be  everything like there won't be a party  there won't be anything else but then  we'd go to the theater and my sisters  would go and I'd be like well  [Applause]  they're still having a party  and getting to see Starlight Express  time it's time time views  Donald Trump and his advisors reportedly  spent today awaiting a potential  indictment with one advisor saying the  former president has quote resigned  himself to the possibility now look it's  not the way we wanted to use the words  Trump and resigned combined but  we'll take it thank you  this meant to happen yesterday  like  seriously they're stretching this out  like it's the you know the end of  like the final of American Idol  it's time to find out whether or not  Trump is getting arrested  Trump is  gonna find out after this break don't go  anywhere  now according to reports Trump has told  his inner circle that he actually wants  to be handcuffed and do a perp walk it's  true Trump believes that since he would  need to surrender himself to authorities  anyway he might as well turn it into a  spectacle  I mean I get it why not sure what I mean  he already moves his hands like he's  wearing handcuffs  you know it's not going to be a big  adjustment  moving on President Biden will be  leaving for Ottawa tomorrow to spend two  days meeting with Canadian Prime  Minister Justin Trudeau although a good  chunk of the trip will be used for a  trump indictment viewing party  what right now I've been thinking about  this I really like President Biden I'm a  huge fan I really really like him what's  going on what's he doing excuse  he's got a lot of time he's with Niall  Horan last week he's with the Ted lasso  cast on Tuesday is it Bruce Springsteen  and Julia Louis Dreyfus yesterday  pressing political issue  is he going to address in Canada  like we're going to tune in like next  week he'll be tackling climate change  with Justin Bieber and Celine Dion  he's got more guests than we do he's  getting Heavy Hitters you got to run for  president dude  I don't think I can  I don't think I can  I don't think I can can I because I'm  going wrong you're not the first group  of people who've come up  um but I don't think I can can I why I  think it's I'm because I'm British oh  yeah do people know that about you that  I'm pretty yeah  no I highlighted pretty well thank you  yeah I think you just reintroduced  yourself you know Jim Gordon how the  hell are you  your way  should you make those words a big cowboy  hat yeah big Bell Amarillo Texas yeah  and I've got a really really really firm  handshake yeah like kind of handshake  the other person the other person's like  whoa yeah  one of the key topics of discussion is  reportedly modernizing the North  American Aerospace Defense command which  is a very fancy way of saying we're  shooting down more of those Dagon  balloons  and according to a new study listen to  this who's American in here put your  hands up if you're an American okay well  get ready American IQ scores have  dropped for the first time in a century  this is it makes sense no  no sir no sir  this is it this is our show's Legacy and  I could not be more proud  now I don't want to make this personal I  don't know why I want to make this  personal at all but if I'm honest right  Ian I saw this happen to you in real  time  what  what can we do to get the scores back up  I don't know dude five years ago I might  have had the answer but uh  I am dumb as hell  I mean for the first time in a century  American IQ scores have fallen and when  asked for comment most Americans were  like what  now I was on Tick Tock  and the bank JP Morgan Chase had an  unpleasant surprise recently they found  out that the 1.3 million dollars worth  of precious metal that they were storing  in a secure Warehouse was actually just  bags filled with rocks yeah more  encouraging news from the banking sector  it might be the saddest way to end any  story  am I in it yeah it turns out it's just a  bag of rocks  yeah and I thought I found the love of  my life turns out it was just a bag of  rocks  honey have found our dream house sorry I  got it's just a bag of rocks now the  bags are supposed to be full of nickel  and the bank has no idea how the bags  got switched out which makes this  situation actually historic it's the  first time anyone has ever wanted  Nickelback  foreign  I don't want to include myself in this  because I'm not American so I I don't  have any beef I don't have any beef in  this I have no skin in this game you all  decided you didn't like him I think  they're great I don't understand baby  came up I understand the beef here they  became a hard punch line here but if you  get yourself anywhere between four and  16 beers deep  and this is how you remind me comes on  you're not having a bad time  I would argue that's true of a lot of  their music I actually think it's I  think it's John I I genuinely mean this  like it's just a pylon yeah on  Nickelback and I don't like it yeah I  think I think part of the blowback is  Binger was a adult man with curly blonde  hair and  like early yeah it's kind of curly here  kind of curly he looked like a  Labradoodle  wavy now  can we bring up a photo the lead singer  and Nickelback I don't think it was  Curly yeah that's a wave that's okay  I know but he's got like if you put  Shakira's face on his head  it would look the same that's Shakira  here but what's wrong with that there's  nothing wrong with I just think you've  all gone too far Shakira's head that's  fine but I'm the guy from Nickelback  very similar I like I like Shakira a  little bit Shakira looks great well I'll  answer this question yeah you've never  seen Shakira and Nickelback in the same  room  moving on a list has come out of the  best and worst tourist attractions in  the world any guesses what do we think  band what do we think was the what was  the best spot tourist attraction what do  we reckon uh the the Library of  Alexandria the Library of Alexandria the  pyramids Hollywood is the worst like  Chinese Theater area right yeah I think  that was the worst that's of course oh  who's at Disneyland there's like oh  there you go you're well I can tell you  the top three tourist attractions uh  include the Blue Lagoon in Iceland  Disneyland in Paris and the Hungarian  Parliament building  small kids we're taking a trip to the  Hungarian Parliament building  right  I've been  I've been to Disneyland Paris and for  the life of me I cannot work out how it  made the top three  it's  I honestly I'm using the word  it is a disgrace it's a disgrace to  the legacy of Mickey Mouse  what is what is so bad are the rides bad  what's so bad about it it's the rides a  fine Space Mountain good everything else  is just  because it's like you know people don't  really the greatest thing about going to  this land is people are like hey kids  and everything's great they usually  someone going  no closed  [Applause]  any idea when it might reopen  no  and now you're saying that that's like  that's Goofy  now this is true Hagar  you'll like this one you were bang on  right  the Hollywood Walk of Fame came in  deadlocked yeah yeah  does the Hungarian Parliament building  have Antonio banderas's name written on  it I don't mean so I don't even the  Hollywood Walk of Fame isn't even an  attraction it's just a sidewalk  it depends on what you're looking for  out of a tourist experience  it's small like you're part of this  world it's beautiful you gotta like you  know Niagara Falls the Blue Mountains in  Sydney right exactly and if you want to  have like someone in an Elmo costume  give you hepatitis  yeah  and did you hear about these scientists  at Columbia University have created the  world's first 3D printed cheesecake the  cheesecake was assembled entirely by a  3D printing machine while simultaneously  being cooked by lasers here it is here  look at that yeah because that's that's  what we all look for in a cheesecake a  crunchy crust that goes all the way  around it  now I'm sure this tastes delicious but  you've got to admit nothing beats the  taste of Grandma's home 3D printing  a printed cheesecake cooked by lasers  think about it we as a society are on  the cusp of creating a literal  Cheesecake Factory and that's your mind  when we come back everybody  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]",

amazing the southern  hospitality is a real thing so that's  glorious  [Applause]  we'll come back on a Monday I'll ask reg  what he did and it's something so  glamorous and gorgeous and I can watch  the light just fade in your eyes as you  realize as she realized I'm gonna turn  this way and you're gonna say spent a  lot of time on the couch yeah yeah  smoked a pork butt though got the Big  Green Egg fired up dude oh no no no  sorry I thought that was slang I thought  that was slang for some news smoking  some new strain of weed that I don't  know about is that what they call it a  pork butt they call it pork butt even  though it's the pork shoulder and yes we  should spend 15 minutes talking about  this right now  it's that time it's time for the news  of course last night was the Academy  Awards that everybody was did you see it  the brilliant show lovely evening went  by without controversy it was a very  different feeling in the room from last  year although I was tense I was still  tense I was just I was waiting for Bill  Nye and Austin Butler to get in some  kind of shoving match Steven Spielberg  The Lean Forward give John Williams a  wet willy nothing how did you do in your  Oscar's pool  oh dude I crushed it last night yeah  everyone crushed it no one was surprised  by anything I got in the wheel I  actually blew some of the bigger  categories where if I would have picked  with my head I would have done even  better but I was picking like best Oscar  short animated short hadn't seen any of  them just went off name alone right and  you when you kind of came through I did  I picked like there was some short film  called like the uh the Irish and I was  like well it's a big night for the Irish  because of the bases of energy well good  for you I mean obviously the big winner  was everything everywhere all at once  taking home seven Oscars including best  picture best director and best original  screenplay it also took home the Oscar  for that movie that makes you realize  that maybe the edible you took was too  strong  fun fact this is the first Best Picture  Winner to prominently feature hot dog  fingers since 1996 is The English  Patient  for the first time in 60 years nominees  entered on something other than a red  carpet organizers opted instead for a  champagne carpet yeah well they say it's  champagne it sounds fancy between you  and me it's actually just a Prosecco  carpet  it's true they did it they said they did  it to evoke  peacefulness  implying that last s just red carpet was  what enraged Will Smith  there was some incredible Oscar Fashions  last night here's Florence Pugh walking  the champagne carpet  she looks amazing  she looks absolutely incredible although  she also looks how I look when I'm in a  hotel and room service shows up earlier  than I thought and I have to use a bed  sheet no no it's I'm coming I'm coming  I love it look at that it says glamor it  says Hollywood it says I can be ready  for a game of volleyball in seconds  Questlove showed up wearing diamond  encrusted Crocs  putting diamonds onto Crocs is basically  like putting caviar on a chili dog  yeah Diamonds Are Made anything look  fancy I'm just going to get a little bag  of diamonds and instead of dressing up  for events I'm just going to glue the  diamonds to sweatpants and I'll be right  there here's the rock in a pink tuxedo  jacket  yeah well you're whooping I hope nobody  needs a prom dress this year because  that jacket single-handedly depleted the  nation's pink style in reserves  okay he looks like if your Grandma's  favorite chair grew legs and walked  through the Oscars now I don't know if  you saw this but Hugh Grant gave an  interview to Ashley Graham last night  and he was absolutely delighted to be  there are you excited to see anybody win  do you have your hopes up for anyone  um  not not no one in particular what are  you wearing tonight then adjust my suit  how fun is it to shoot something like  that well I'm barely in it I'm in it for  about three seconds yeah but still you  showed up and you had fun right uh  almost  oh  yeah I love it  he's at the Academy Awards you should be  treating this like one of the Four  Weddings not the funeral  because you the thing here is you've got  to match the question to the person you  know you can ask Timothy chalamet what  he's wearing you've got to ask Hugh  Grant what he thinks about the 18th  century poet William Blake's theory that  the human imagination is proof of the  Divine  your nominee Thames made things very  very people sitting behind her in the  auditorium because well she wore this  I mean  those poor people sat behind her  hello  if someone's wearing that in front of  you I do think it's totally acceptable  to just cut out two eye holes  so you can see  everyone looks like they're at the  Oscars Thames looks like she's at a  meeting of the galactic Senate  Paul Rogers won for best uh he won the  best editing award for everything  everywhere all at once and he gave a  very chill speech mentioning how he's  winning an Oscar for only his second  ever movie uh  too much this is my second film y'all  this is crazy  first off that man is too handsome to be  locked away in a dark room editing  isn't he can't be an editor  I see this guy I don't I don't know him  but I see this guy a lot he's got major  hot dad at a trendy preschool energy do  you know what I mean he isn't winning an  Oscar that guy's picking up his son  who's called like Jagger or Fox  while drinking a nine dollar cup of pour  over coffee just  Lady Gaga yeah  we have we have pretty hot editors you  know yeah  maybe Adam  maybe editors are just hot  can I be honest yeah I think we as a  group right right as a group of men yeah  in a workplace right are not that hot  I'm including I'm including all I mean  like I'm I'm putting myself way down I'm  not dissing and I'm saying as a group  just as a group I don't think anyone  walks into the offices of The Late Late  Show and goes goes  for a hot Bunch this is yeah but I'm not  saying we're unattracted I'm just saying  yes our editors are not unattractive  yeah but I think we as a species within  the show  have lowered the bar  you know what I mean take Guillermo out  the band the band becomes a cry for help  [Applause]  oh man you know  again no disrespect pictures of the  editors have we got pictures of the  editors  I don't think any of them have got  online profiles cheers  a lot of that is  that or Ford fraudulent Behavior you  know  yeah  [Music]  right that's a good one that's a proper  hot dude that's a hot guy bro I'm I'm  with you I just I'm saying we're looking  at it  it's like if we all did if we all did  the long jump yeah no one would be good  at the long jump but someone would win  it  is you know  snake someone somebody would jump the  furthest and we go wow that was amazing  you won the long jump they didn't win  anything they'd be  this I just you're making me feel insane  right now because I think we're all like  hot dude hot dude hot dude hot dude hot  dude  hot dude I look in the mirror and I  can't tell if Pedro Pascal broke into my  house or what's going on correct  we've gone way off track yeah  Lady Gaga performed her oscar-nominated  song Hold My Hand from Top Gun Maverick  and for the first 45 seconds the camera  was very zoomed in have a look  I wrote this song with my friend blood  pop  for the film top gun Maverick and my  studio basement  [Applause]  it's deeply personal for me and I think  that we all need each other  [Laughter]  I mean  it was zoomed in So Close you could see  everything unless of course you were sat  behind Thames then you couldn't see  anything I mean it's an interesting  choice isn't it bold but like you could  you it's certainly Brave so make  yourself that vulnerable do you know  what I mean like I know I would be I  would be nervous that's not something I  would ever feel confident of no way Tim  wait what are you doing no no  I love that she starts that with I wrote  this with my friend blood pop  blood pop  no blood  pop  oh hey guys you've done this is um this  is Chris Andy Neil Simon blood pop David  friend blood  is that a basement  with a basement either way either way  you've got hundreds of millions of  dollars I'm sure you could be in a  studio  there isn't in a basement oh it's where  blood pops happiest cool be safe  uh and if you watched I'm sure you  noticed this  the the academy tried to get more people  uh to to learn more by flashing  scannable QR codes on the screen they  even did it after the in memoriam  section now when you when you scan the  QR code you only have to watch two  tasteful Dr Pepper ads before seeing who  else had died last year  no one watching the Oscars is pulling  out their phone to scan a QR code mostly  because they're already on their phone  phones Googling how to get ozempic  this odd moment Melissa McCarthy and  Hallie Bailey uh took to the stage as if  they were presenting an awards and then  they just showed an ads on ABC for their  parent company Walt Disney have a look  so we are so excited to give you the  first look at our upcoming film coming  to theaters May 26th they should have  just gone all in pulled out an envelope  and everything  and like and the Oscar for the next  commercial goes to  The Little Mermaids  that's strange I think they've done that  before have they  've done an ad in the show I think it's  a little tasteless to run an art in the  middle of a TV show you know anyway  Keurig Brew the love  and did you catch this during his  acceptance speech the producer of  everything everywhere all at once meant  to say no prophets are more important  than a person but got a little mixed up  no person is more important than  Prophets  yeah  all the all the producers the studio  hits their heads in the room were like  finally someone said it  was all the speeches last night were  about the power of film and how dreams  can come true it was nice to finally  hear something honest  there were a lot of exciting wins some  incredible speeches last night there  really well but no one was more shocked  and overcome with excitement than Jamie  Lee Curtis here she is here  now she's really excited do you think  she's making that face because she's one  but look who was sat in front of her  and at the end of the night there was  this touching moment when kihi Guan  hugged Harrison Ford after Ford  presented the Best Picture award it was  an incredibly sweet moment and reminded  a lot of people of Quan's first role in  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  look at that  [Applause]  spring in Harrison Ford's ear who's the  Short Round now [ __ ] and that's the  news  [Applause]  music starting tomorrow night tomorrow  night this is our first carport in how  long Rob about eight months in eight  months it's been away for eight months  and we have a brand

you're in London yeah were you doing you  were doing the The Comedy Festival thing  you were playing a show O2 the O2 is 002  just for Just for Laughs yeah how did it  go oh man it was it was awesome yeah  just landed did a really cool show  called stamptown and then uh the next  night did a a show at the club it was it  was really great man it was it was like  so fast but yeah but it was great I made  it back in time for this show how you  doing coms all good yeah I'm good yeah  yeah I went to Burbank  I got a text from Ian last night like 8  45 it just said I'm watching Jerry  Maguire yeah  when their wives are out of town 100  yeah so but you said you had you had  some real Solitude I didn't speak to  anyone that entire day until we talked  yeah yeah and you just lent into it you  lent into the silence and what did you  find out about yourself  that uh deep down at the at the very  core right in there of who I am right  down in the granular base level we're  pretty boring guy  it's that time it's time for the news  and later this week President Biden will  be releasing his budget but his  administration is already leaking the  fact the Biden will propose a tax  increase to keep Medicare solvent  practically daring Republicans to come  out against it because nothing says  don't worry you'll still be okay when  you retire like an 80 year old president  who refuses to retire  keeping Medicare solvents keeping  Medicare solvent it's not exciting but  it's important it's the weeknight sex of  politics  Biden's budget will propose raising  attacks on Americans earning more than  four hundred thousand dollars it's a  brilliant idea from a guy who  coincidentally makes exactly four  hundred thousand dollars  in other news Donald Trump's attorneys  are asking to delay the trial date of  the former president's fraud case  because they say the New York attorney  general has so much evidence they can't  review it all in time apparently there  are 2.6 million pages of evidence  yeah see when you think about it these  are the documents that Trump should have  stolen  [Applause]  it's thought about it  I love how Trump's I love how Trump's  defense team is like there's so much  evidence of fraud  we don't even have enough time to review  it also he's innocent  it's a it's a pretty smart strategy by  Trump this it is commits so much fraud  that by the time they're ready for trial  you'll be president of the United States  again and it'll  and according to his allies Donald Trump  is currently testing out new nicknames  for his chief Republican rival Governor  Ron DeSantis while he seems to be set on  Rhonda sanctimonious he's also  considering Ron dishonest Ron D  establishments and Tiny d  nice to see Trump  laser focused on the most important  issues of the day isn't it  tiny D makes it sound like he's going to  release a song with DJ Khaled  Khalid ice spice and Tiny d  what happened to meatball wrong was that  wrong DeSantis apparently Trump never  came up with meatball Ron and it just  got out there but which is too big  because it is  I think you should see should run the  whole way with meatball runs yeah you  should call him Ron Ron DNC to associate  him with the  wow  and with Run DMC or tiny ball oh what  sorry oh tiny balls tiny balls tiny  balls  tiny balls  just call him tiny balls  I I I'm not mad at it  I'm not mad at it it's  [Music]  you know when everyone says Napoleon was  really short like you know he was a he  was above average height right right and  that was just all propaganda if he went  with tiny balls it's very difficult for  Ron DeSantis to come out and go I have  regular sized balls  tiny balls  oh tiny bowls but he could even go one  further Big D tiny balls because that's  that's the worst if you've got a big  like little like Tic Tacs  in a regular sack  the sack's not small it's the balls  [Applause]  and have you seen this  and have you seen this wax figures of  Prince William and Princess Kate have  gone viral after a tick tocker recently  posted a clip from quote the worst Wax  Museum in Poland for a reminder here's  the actual Prince and Princess of Wales  just here and here are the wax versions  yeah  that whacks Prince William looks like he  just walked in  it looks like he just walked into Prince  Andrew's room by mistake  what's happened to this they look like  their bodies were just lifted out of the  Titanic  although on the plus side at least we  all know now what they both look like if  they got infected in The Last of Us  those two photos side by side are  perfect it's like  it's like when the edible hits mean  can help Men last three times longer in  bed yeah  I'll tell you something this is the  first time in the history of this show  that my wife has texted me a news story  maybe you could use this for the show  now in some cases it just seemed longer  because the men wouldn't shut up about  going oh my God yoga will change your  eyes  this is true after 12 weeks of yoga the  time went from an average of just under  26 seconds to almost a minute and a half  26 seconds I didn't realize this was a  study of tantric sex  you've ever giving it a go yoga  no I probably should I'm getting tight  yeah I got a bad back right now yeah I  had to go I I tried yoga and I fell  asleep  completely true story that completely  true story because the guy was just like  look  it's just this is all about small gains  just over time this is where you just  like lie down breathe and then I was out  yeah  that's completely asleep  and uh and he got like annoyed with me  the the dude got annoyed and I was like  you just said to just completely relax  you know if you don't like yoga you have  you tried frozen yogurt  some days I sit and I think well should  we end the show  like is this silly  walking out on you know the best moment  of your life and then there's moments  like that and I think no no it's 100  time  um we wanted to show you this the Boston  Dynamics robot dog took the runway at a  fashion show the other day have a look  at this so look there's the robot dog  there interacting with the model on the  runway then the robot helps her out of  her wrap right by taking her garment and  then at the very end just hands it back  to her just there look  17 dead at that fashion show  so I'm inside the gospel for you after

I mean that's all  right yeah 10 years 10 years in a month  no it's no no 15 years ago down to the  day we're not going down to the day Rob  We're Not Gonna think I I was okay all  right 20 years ago yeah okay I'm sorry  that I was off but I actually don't  think it was 2012. I actually don't  think it was 2012. it was 2012. sorry it  was 2012.  like I say I actually don't think it was  2012.  it was 2012. okay  I'll tell you what  I some nights I cannot wait to get out  of here  at all  um no so Gordon says hey you guys should  come over for dinner we're like ah no it  wasn't 2012.  it was in 2012 because Jules was  pregnant with Max because Gordon opened  an incredible bottle of wine and Jules  was like I can't drink and it wasn't I  think it was 2009 bra  so I have to remind you your son's 11.  so the math works on 2012.  Jones is pregnant no because 2012 he was  born okay he was born in 2011. he's 12  in March he was born in 2011 which means  she was pregnant so it was Christmas  2010 which puts it Rob 12 13 years ago  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  she was she was pregnant because he  opened this wine I remember George going  I really want something anyway this has  really gone off track it's such a boring  story it's irrelevant now cute you get  boring absolutely what did you eat  though what did you make so we had to we  were late because we had to go somewhere  else and Gordon said  don't you worry I'm gonna cook you your  own Beef Wellington yeah and he did they  were eating something else and we got  there and it was oh  so beautiful it was glorious and when  was this again foreign  [Applause]  last night right here in Los Angeles  because LeBron James broke Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar's 38-year record to become  the NBA  NBA time a leading scorer  I know you're watching the game stopped  for 10 minutes while LeBron celebrated  it was just enough time for Kareem to  step onto the court make a layup and  take the title back again  I've got to say I was watching it last  night as a man in my 40s it was very  depressing  it was deeply depressing to hear the  announcers talk about it they were like  it's unbelievable he  said 30 years old he's ancient older  than time itself it's a miracle the man  can even walk at this age  here's LeBron on the court thanking the  fans and his teammates  man thank you guys  thank you I'm glad you did it that way  around it's way better than going thanks  man you guys  you break the NBA all-time scoring  record you should get to swear on  television whenever you want for the  rest of your life it's fine you can be  like my name's LeBron James I think you  should drink a Gatorade  now of course the big  push from last night was President Biden  delivered his State of the Union Address  the speech was the longest of Biden's  presidency at 73 minutes but honestly it  was so fun and fast-paced it really only  felt like 71 minutes  this is true Biden spoke  9191 words beating Bill Clinton's 1995  speech by one word Biden was like see  LeBron ain't the only Legend sharing  records tonight  the Knight got off to an odd start with  first lady Jill Biden and second  gentleman Doug emhoff greeting each  other by kissing fully on the lips  look at that the state of the union is  extremely horny  again it's an awkward moment all eyes  are on you you know the pressure to look  normal is so high and you go and  accidentally kiss the president's wife  on the lips  now Jill Biden actually had Bono there  as a guest  um but here he is right here look at  Bono there I love that he's watching and  clapping like oh yeah slip a tongue in  man slippery tongue  you know what happened I think he popped  a Bono  before Biden even had a chance to speak  things got a bit contentious with the  Republican Mitt Romney telling  Republican George Santos in a tense  exchange you don't belong here here they  are just here look at that Mitt Romney  rolling with some real vice principal at  high school rally energy  it's a very awkward exchange Romney  introduced himself like excuse me I'm  selling a Mitt Romney and Santos was  like no I think you'll find I'm Senator  Mitt Romney  but when he walked in when he walked in  you could tell you could tell Mitt  Romney was ready for a fight he had the  smell of whole milk on his breath  foreign  Cinema stood out in the crowd with her  outfit a bright yellow dress with poofy  shoulders  Biden showed up to deliver the State of  the Union speech and Kirsten Cinema  showed up as I assumed to deliver a  bridesmaid speech hello cousin she is a  very accomplished woman capable woman a  sitting U.S senator it isn't fair to  reduce her to the clothing she wears but  this is a late night talk show and she  showed up to the State of the Union  dressed like a piece of bow tie pasta  thank you  we can't knock their enemy we have to  say something  we have to  look you all know this about me Ian I'm  not afraid to talk politics what's your  favorite pasta dish  you can't be able to catch you a Pepe  just felt like it's a bit  I catch you it's easy to do bad it's  easy  pepper cheese and egg in it right and if  you can make those three ingredients  sing brother you got something going  and I'll give you that yeah what's your  favorite part I like a papa Deli  yeah exactly I enjoy saying it yeah  I enjoy eating it it's all spicy right  Papa Deli I like a papa Deli Ragu yeah  daily yeah is that how you'd say  it's a butterfly  that's what you know they love that in  Italian restaurants when you do an  Italian accent  what about you what about you reg go to  go to Pasta you're in an Italian  restaurant probably  okay  throughout the speech or I just jump in  I I have to mention it because it's also  very good it's also very good  but it's a potato based pasta  folks it's one of those  throughout the speech House Republicans  put the spotlight on themselves with  booze taunts Grunts and sarcastic  chortles here's the moment when things  got really contentious some Republicans  want Medicare and Social Security Sunset  I'm not saying it's a majority  let me give you anybody who doubts it  contact my office I'll give you a copy  I'll give you a copy of The Proposal  look at find these absolutely loving it  he's this close because this ghost is  stepping away from the podium being like  Oh what  it did get Rowdy It Go Rowdy one  Republican he even screamed we want Jill  and Doug to kiss again  foreign  Republican Marjorie Taylor green kept  standing up  Republican Martin Taylor green kept  standing up and booing the president  throughout the speech at one point even  yelled a liar out of force of habit  George Santos immediately jumped up and  was like no I'm not  here she is  during one of her outbursts look at that  if you're gonna if you're gonna Heckle  the president definitely do it while  you're dressed like a Disney villain  foreign  Taylor green now includes President  Biden and every bartender at any TGI  Fridays  ma'am I'm sorry I'm cutting you off  you've had enough like boom  try to use the opportunity to trap  Republicans into keeping Social Security  and Medicare intact have a look folks  as we all apparently agree  Social Security Medicare is off the off  the books now right  all right  that's oh that's how you get Jill back  I'm such a crowd pleaser I wouldn't be  surprised if President Biden opens every  meeting with Social Security and  Medicare or off the books now you're  like  uh sir that you're pardoning a turkey  for the most part Biden stuck to the  prepared speech except at one point he  got very worked up talking about being  in competition with China  name me a world leader  who changed places with Xi Jinping name  me one  name me one  oh I don't know I don't like it when he  does that it gives me like pop quiz  vibes  no I'm there like oh I said name you why  is it Justin Trudeau I'm gonna say  final answer just intro  why is he so angry about it does he  think the US is trying to trade him to  China like it's a sports team  overall Biden's message was clear and  forceful or at the very least it was  forceful  make no mistake  if you try anything to raise the cost of  Brazilian jobs I will Victor  so what was that would you say can you  repeat that  raise the cost of reasons  it's a good strategy just keep guessing  but I think so what hey that's what  Biden to know and you to find out look  at vice president Karma Harris in the  back straight up that's a true friend  she's like didn't understand the word  but I'm coming anyway  on that note I am James Corden and that  that was the first we'll be right back  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]",

      "page_content": "thank you  hey gang how are you  um thanks for this here's the news  I've I've signed a new  contract with the Late Late Show  um  and it will be my last contract that I  signed as the host of this show  um  and the show will stop  in a year's time  there's two there's too many things to  say there's too many things I'd like to  say it's too much  love  for real as we come to the end of it I  am  unbelievably sad that it's coming to an  end but also full of understanding why  the time might be right to bring it to a  close and just thankful for the amazing  times we've all had it's set I'm sad the  show's ending it's been such a great  experience and it's such a wonderful  group of people I'm so proud of all the  work we've done here and I'm like  impressed by James so like walk away and  move on because it's not easy to do  always always known that one day I will  be stood here for the last time I think  all good things need to come to an end  that if you go on forever  you lose what makes you special it's  very rare in television that you get to  call your own shots and I think it's  really  amazing that James he's going to go no  no that's it I've done my time gratitude  is is the word that comes across first  you know eventually I think you'll think  about the Legacy that we've left in late  night which is you know 70 years worth  of television and like the show's gonna  stand out that phrase in The Late Late  Show won't exist on CBS anymore it is a  franchise that's been around for 30  years it's always sad to wind down a  franchise and even though it's ending I  think that it deserves its spot in the  history of the format The Late Late Show  starring Tom Snyder  [Applause]  28 years ago I was at the very first  Late Late Show with Tom Snyder and now I  will be at the last Late Late Show with  James Corden Tim has directed every  every single episode of The Late Late  Show we've got an 80 job with Tom Snyder  was ad for Craig Kilbourne then became  deck director of Craig Ferguson and is  now the director of this show right now  I feel so fortunate to have been on this  show for so long I mean I put 28 years  into the show and started at the bottom  and now to be fortunate enough to direct  the show and to spend the last eight  years with the most talented people the  people here the environment that's been  created is far greater than anything we  have ever put on screen this is a real  family unit of people who really love  working here they love each other it's a  really beautiful experience that I think  will be hard to rival the fundamental  thing that I will miss more than  anything I've got to go to work with  absolute friends and make friendships  that I will carry the rest of time TV is  one of those jobs where when you're in  production it's kind of unlike many  others because it's so intense doing a  late night show is like sprinting a  marathon it is exhausting and it is like  never ending you're working with people  all hours day every day for so many  years so it's obviously very sad and to  say goodbye to all these people because  it's been such a family for so long  we're not leaving today we still have a  year to go and I am we are all  determined to make this the best year we  have ever had making this show we are  going to go out with a bang that's going  to be carpools and crosswalks and  sketches the thing as we're coming to  the end of the show it's hard to believe  that we're here already but I think it's  really really important how things end I  think it's really important that things  end in the manner that they began 48  shows ago  so I guess it's just how do we make sure  that these last 48 shows are like the  best ones we do and we just do  everything that we can do to make these  shows as memorable as they possibly can  be that's what today's about a way to be  away from the studio and to really just  put these Brilliant Minds together and  think about what we can do James has  done a lot of things that Tom Cruise  to a musical you my boy are in  the theater James would integrate Tom  Cruise into the musical make him do like  a tap okay well there is something  really funny in the theory of that I've  done loads of you like I've jumped out  of planes I've done this I've read and  I've done this I've done that now it's  time for you to do stuff that I like and  it's like all that stuff we will perform  live in The Lion King  it's it's just crazy I mean you have  Maverick standing there like giving you  two days to shoot a lion king thing  we're not young what  Tom Cruise is someone who pushes us to  be the best that we can because he wants  everything to be as good as it can be  and it's time for our last adventure  together and I  there's really no need for us to be  friends after you've finished it you  look me in the eyes and tell me I'm  wrong when Mission Impossible 17 comes  out you're not gonna you're not gonna  think of me now you're not gonna think  of me you're going to be off base  jumping with bow and yang it is  he's one of the stars that puts so much  into it that it really makes everyone be  on top of their game and we want to be  the best we can for him and he's the  best he can be for us  you all have brought so much joy to so  many people you're so enormously  talented and I always have an incredible  time and I'm telling you this is not the  end of our creative relationship  he's a mate I mean he's amazing I love  you too  so we should also think about some of  our like Classic Bits carpool and be  like who haven't we done yet as we'll do  Bad Bunny we'll do that when I was ex  James is there a crosswalk you want to  do before it ends I'm Singing in the  Rain we're looking oh yeah  the other day  is Hollywood yeah it's about Hollywood  crosswalk is one of our biggest and most  ambitious pieces that we do when it  first started there's an idea by our  co-head writer Ian Carmel which was  let's just put on a show on the  crosswalk crosswalk started as like a  small production it was like James a few  other actors leather jackets and like  not a whole lot of props and over the  years it's evolved and evolved and we've  had Stars such as Will Smith and the  cast of Beauty and the Beast and Adina  Menzel running out onto a crosswalk  singing songs in front of actual traffic  and then running off across walking we  flew to Paris Indiana we've done it in  New York London like it's become like a  gigantic bed it's funny and big and  ambitious and everything we've tried to  do and it's so much fun to produce it is  the fun  crosswalk the joy we have  had making magic pushing the envelope  it's just been a dream come true and I'm  so thankful for James Corden and your  huge vision and the entire team  foreign  [Applause]  we're here to tell you you can't just  leave a talk show another life goes on  WE James and then what follows is like a  grilling about leaving late night if  we're gonna let you leave we need to  know you'll keep our sacred secrets and  then what do you know you know that we  don't actually read the books we know  that we've never watched any of the  movies you know that we don't find any  of the jokes funny the fake laugh we all  have for when a guest tells a story that  isn't funny  maybe they cut off a finger  I have as many as we wanted in that  sketch sort of the late popping on  Darkness you can shoot them all over the  place yeah I think it's brilliant God  did speak to me and he told me I don't  need to be in this bit it's essentially  the sketch we did on episode one where  James is like learning how to video  What It Takes probably not but it's the  end of it now you're leaving and this is  what happens to you it has been an honor  to share this time slot with you for the  last eight years you have done so many  inventive things with this format that  nobody did before and you're really  going to be missed it was great having  you in this family I always like this  song you did at the end of episode one  yes and I think that might also be an  effective sweet way of ending the 1237  version of our show on our last day my  name is James Corden and tonight's who  dreams came true to look like I can play  piano and to host this show for you so  good night  thanks for watching  that's our show  it feels a bit like you know when you  watch those like slow motion videos of a  crash test dummy where you absolutely  know what's coming but it's still like  25 shows away or whatever  so like the damage is sort of going like  this and you're like oh you're about to  have a real impact something's coming  it's going it just takes ages before  their face like and then suddenly they  just go  it feels like that you're like  strapped in  looking at everyone you love and you're  driving the car that's how it feels I'm  really really just trying to keep it  together realize what a privilege it is  to say goodbye in the manner that we are  right now I'm really proud that we went  100 for the entire run of this show from  day one starting with Tom Hanks doing  roll call to you know the very last show  where we have Tom Cruise doing The Lion  King it has been  100 miles an hour I think the last show  will say it all it will be exactly  like the first it will be  entertaining  joyful  and everything  [Music]  foreign",

wonderful adventure and and I have  uh if I wanted to I've I've struggled at  times I've I've struggled to  find the words to sum up what this past  eight years has meant to me it is almost  impossible I I frankly I don't know  where to start  but I sit here now today with nothing  but love  gratitude and pride this show is  everything it is everything I ever  wanted it to be and uh I've got to tell  you if you if you like this show and  you're tuned in here in the in the  middle of the night or online I cannot  stress enough that I am I am just one  part of a big team who make this show  this incredible family here  who have made The Late Late Show and so  many of our team  here they started this show on day one  and here we are 1200 shows later and I  would like to take this moment to thank  each and every one of you who works on  this show from the bottom of my heart  for the love and the dedication that you  have given  to making this show what it is today I  love every single one of you I will  forever be in your corner always always  always I told you last night  this was never my show  this was never my show it was ours and  I'm gonna miss every single don't this  time  I'm gonna miss every single one of you  so much I wanna I wanna if you let me I  want to say uh  a huge thank you to Reggie in the band  um  when um  when Reggie said that he'd that he'd  come and he'd join the show it changed  everything for me it really really did  it changed it was the first time that I  thought we might actually be able to do  something new and fresh and I love you  so much man I love you I thank you for  taking a leap with me on this  and for putting together this  unbelievable band to Hagar Guillermo Tim  and Steve I could never have imagined it  would have been this great  and over the past few years Ian you were  you were I can't look at you while I say  this if that's all right you Ian you  were the second writer that we hired on  this show  and from the minute we met I was like I  think I've just met the funniest person  I will ever meet in my life and you have  never ever let me down and I'm so lucky  that you and Lauren are the head writers  here because  both of you your work your dedication  your your precision and your skill has  been incredible and I can't thank you  both enough  um we are very very lucky to be on a  network like CBS I cannot express how  fantastic they have been with me from  day one  it's unfathomable why they took a chance  on me to do this job I will never  understand it but they have supported  and they have loved this show and  I will be forever grateful for what  they've done for me and my  family it's been uh  it's been life-changing  it really has because  moving here to America  moving here to America eight years ago  it was a huge leap for me my family  my son was three her daughter was 12  weeks old and we now have another small  person and she's American yeah  we uh  you know we started this show we started  with Obama  then Trump  then a global pandemic and and I've  watched I've watched America change a  lot over these past few years I've  watched I've watched divisions grow and  and I've seen and I've felt a sense of  negativity bubble and it points boil  over  and I guess all I really want to say  tonight is I implore you to remember  what America  signifies to the rest of the world my  entire life it has always been a place  of optimism and joy and yes it has flaws  so many but show me a country that  doesn't show me a person that doesn't me  you all of us we are all trying to  figure this out we are every single one  of us a work in progress and just  because somebody disagrees with you it  doesn't make them bad or evil we are all  more the same than we are  different and there are so many people  there are so many people who are  who are trying to stoke those  differences and we have to try as best  we can to look for the light look for  the joy because if you do it's out there  and that's all this show  has ever been about all we've ever  wanted is just be a little a little bit  of light and levity at the end of your  day thank you for letting me do this  thank you for letting me into your home  every night  I've never taken for granted what an  absolute privilege this has been now  look when we come back  when we come back  you are gonna be absolutely shocked at  how we are going to end this show guess  what  we're going to end with a song I know  what are the chances come on back  everybody  [Applause]  [Music]  now the last guest has gone from the  Green Room and our last conversation is  done  the final rehearsal is over  and the final commercial has run no more  late late Tinder for swiping no more  torturous games for a laugh  no more risking my life on a fighter jet  or learning too much about our staff  squeezing myself into Spanx every night  for 1200 times in a row  so good night  thanks for watching  that's our show  [Music]  [Applause]  lost karaoke's been coupled and we all  came along for the right  the Lost spill your Cuts has been  swallowed and I'm still feeling nauseous  inside  and soon I will head home to London but  I'll sure miss it here in L.A  the weather my friends and those micro  green salads I claim that I eat every  day  and Reggie will no longer ask people  questions that aren't the least bit  apropos  what is the nature of time  as always  night  thanks for watching  it's our show  that's our show that producers directors  designers the ones who set the lights  and answer phones and do the edit  writing sketches working cameras  building Graphics making costumes  booking Talent mixing sound and never  getting any credit our show was a  creation of the love and dedication  shared by everyone here in the crew  I'm grateful for the eight years I spent  with them  and the eight years I spent here with  you  as the end of the show Fast approaches  gaze at the studio floor  we filled it with thousands of moments  of joy and now there won't be any more  yet I know as I look in the camera  for the very last time as your host  that each of those thousands of moments  of Joy it's the one I'll remember the  most  and part of me thinks why not stay here  forever but deep in my heart I just know  almost shows to be showing  time I was going  it's time  [Music]  thanks for watching  that's our show  thank you so much for your time  everybody I will miss you good night  [Music]  foreign  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]",

your family have really  spanned this whole time for me and and  the best thing I can say and I tried to  say at the start of the show is you are  exactly the same person that I met then  in your core and your person truly and  it's a credit to you and it's a credit  to your family it really really is I  mean Natalie Natalie you you achieved  huge success at a very young age you've  made so many iconic movies do you have a  favorite film or a favorite memory from  one in in this extraordinary career well  I I'm sure Black Swan is like the most  I've met my husband  yeah  um that's like the rest of my life  followed because of that movie  it's so brilliant it's incredible it  really is you've been doing a little bit  of acting please apparently please  sitting here I know you ring Donald  Glover's new series I was I was if you  could think of a project that you want  what would it be would you see Billy  eilish in a rom-com would you be in a  Bond movie you've already done the song  for a body I know like what are we  talking about what's the dream role I  don't know I would have to it would have  to I mean honestly swarm was kind of a  dream role for me that was a big when  that when that was brought up to me I  was like oh this is um this is the thing  this is what I want to do I mean you  know Donald Glover is like my all-time  hero like lifelong hero so old time wow  okay sorry  she's changed is what I'm saying she's  safe  that's me I want to talk about this  you've been posting some very popular  cooking videos online right they're  brilliant if you were competing like on  say like Top Chef or Hell's Kitchen or  the Bake Off which show would Natalie  Portman have the best chance of winning  I'm I'm a top chef Die Hard okay I think  I've watched enough that I probably I  hope I've gotten something from it yeah  what's your let's say let's say Billy  and I are coming over because Donald  Glover's busy we're coming over  let's say Billy and I are coming out for  dinner what do you cook what are you  whipping up  um maybe like a  vegan couscous oh maybe no what's that  face  maybe you're not invited that wasn't a  nice day  I'm I honestly if that's the opener I'm  fine  things that I'm like  two things what vegan and couscous but  if I'm going around to Natalie Portman's  I really want like a good you know like  a nice little Pad Thai or something okay  okay somewhere I will I will bring it I  am going to go to Natalie's house  thank you and I will bring a pad thai  and there's no reason that the three of  us can't get along and have a bloody  nice time okay now Billy in amongst this  extraordinary time you've just headlined  Lollapalooza in South America  and it's hard for anybody to get to even  figure out what that is have a look this  is a snippet of what the crowd was like  when Billy was headlining  [Music]  it's amazing and you've already played a  lot of festivals when it's when it's  that many people how do you feel how do  you feel that you're connecting with the  entire audience the people that are very  very bad yeah man it's hard it I mean  you can't really I I find that you know  I love playing festivals it's like one  of my favorite types of shows to do  um you know because it's just a c it's  just you stand there and it's just  endless people and it's really it's like  a feeling that I I don't get in any  other like aspect of my life it's really  really incredible and it's hard to be  present sometimes but I would say  festivals I feel like you know it might  not be all your your fans or your crowd  and so I feel like I have to prove  something in a way that makes me feel  like I feel better like I'm like working  harder I'm like do I'm putting more  effort into it almost and then I also I  like to go out we call it a Thrust which  is like the Hat walk thing in the front  and then I'll look back at the stage and  I'll see myself on the Giant imags and  like it feels like I'm really at the  show and I'm like in the audience and  I'm watching my me on stage well I want  to say it's incredible and you're going  to be headlining Lollapalooza again in  Chicago and uh which is August 3rd and  people are gonna have the greatest time  stick around  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]",

[Applause]  wow yeah as I  do you know anything happened here I  think we thought he was 20 and at the  last moment someone's gone no no it's  just been confirmed he's 21. add a one  to that and someone's gone Karina's gone  sure whatever  National Guardsman in connection with  the leaking of classified documents that  were posted online the leaker is  described as a lonely young man who is  part of a chat room group that shares  the love of guns and military gear you  know how sometimes you know you find  yourself going it's it's always Who  You'd least suspect isn't it this isn't  one of those times  as a 21 year old he's devastated that  this mistake May cost him his future but  he's also thrilled that he's posted  something online and it totally went  viral  he posted some of the documents in a  chat room for gamers and I don't even  know how this works does someone like  right hey guys how do I win in fortnite  and then you respond like I don't know  but here's some satellite images of  Ukraine  meanwhile President Biden continued his  tour of Ireland today meeting with  President Michael D Higgins at his  official residence in Dublin  look at that I gotta say I Ireland's  president is so adorable isn't he  okay no he's a very very serious and  accomplished politician but I I would  like to chase him around and tickle him  oh where's he going  he looks like if Bernie Sanders turned  into a Hobbit  at one point in the state reception room  Biden wrote a message in the visitors  book as he sat at what can only be  described as a very small desk  or as president Higgins calls it it's a  regular-sized desk  so we're reading this earlier in the in  the with all the Monarch group all the  writers with we're reading this and uh  and Nate Goes what did you say Nate in  the writers meeting you know it just  feels like we're not covering how small  that desk is well enough  there's a lot more to be said about how  small that desk is and I said okay Nate  let's see how the show's going see how  the vibe is if you've got more to say on  it you could say what have you got there  is this the jokes that you submitted  earlier this morning yes that were  unfairly rejected about how small  the desk is  um so we had that conversation earlier  and then I had them put a microphone on  me and I came down here which I don't  normally do but um you're normally in  the car by now  [Music]  what is that that does James that desk  is so small it looks like it belongs on  The Tonight Show with tiny Timmy Fallon  yep I went there and I'll go even  further because that desk James is so  small that even those tiny desk concerts  are like we can't work with this thing  I mean that desk is so small if you put  a coffee cup on it the desk is like damn  is this a coffee jug  pages so if if we're short on Time come  back to me okay if we if we if we if it  lags a little I might I might just say  hey Nate how small is that desk well  James I mean that death is so small  oh small is it now when I when I say I  got it at Staples I'm talking about  actual Staples  thank you Nate photo everybody  okay  tell her Biden though Biden's having a  great time on this trip isn't he on the  island although at one point during his  meeting with President Higgins he  actually had this to say  I'm not going home  and this is incredible place  and 70 of Americans were like okay  okay seriously though you can't blame  him okay like right now President Biden  is out there he's in a beautiful country  everybody's excited to see him and after  this he has to fly back to Washington DC  where Marjorie Taylor green is trying to  ban oxygen because trans people breathe  it  in other news King Charles is hiring  someone to answer his fan mail  Buckingham Palace put out a job posting  for an assistant correspondence officer  to craft responses to each of the  thousands of letters that get addressed  to the king each year imagine having to  respond to every piece of mail you'd be  like the king would like to thank you  Bed Bath and Beyond for this most  generous of coupons  applicants must have excellent written  and verbal communication prowess strong  I.T skills and the ability to discard  any letter that's addressed to prince  Andrew  do you think I should apply for this job  the timing's perfect yeah you had you  had a lot of time off coming up I guess  I get your what is it you you reply to  letters I guess my only question is like  how big is the desk you'd be sitting at  the dune  [Laughter]  or because that  that desk was so small it thinks a  Post-It note a regular piece of paper  and did you see this last night the  Chicago Bulls played the Toronto Raptors  and DeMar DeRozan's nine-year-old  daughter went viral due to her  high-pitched screams to distract the  Raptors attempting free throws here she  is here  and here's the voice you're hearing when  Raptors shoot she's screaming  [Applause]  Championship Behavior I love it I love  that I do the same thing my kids are  sitting in the crowd at Seth Meyer's  show right now  now I tell you what  a strategy worked watch this official  visit to Florida State basketball life  is really good for him right now he's in  a good headspace coming into this in  terms of the total number of the quality  of shots comes off  [Applause]  the Bulls ended up winning by four  points if the Bulls win the championship  she should 100 get a ring I do believe  that  although you watch that clip this is how  you know you understand we know like  people you know the games got soft you  know it's got a little soft in the old  days Michael Jordan would have shown up  at that girl's school the next day and  screamed every time she tried to answer  a math problem  yeah  and finally Bush's beans is giving you  the chance to win a free vacation to a  national park where you can stay in a  one-of-a-kind camper that's shaped like  a giant can of beans here it is here  there it is there and this is the inside  you can tell it's an American promotion  If This Were in Britain the bed would be  a giant slice of toast  it's an impressive space unfortunately  you can't enter your room that's in a  can of beans without one of these  [Applause]  everybody  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]",

[APPLAUSE] >> James: REG, HOW WAS YOUR EASTER? >> Reggie: OH, I WAS IN LONDON. >> James: WHAT? YOU BLOW MY MIND WITH YOUR TRIPS.

WHEN I'VE BEEN DOING IS OBSERVING ALL OF YOU FOR THE LAST 38 YEARS OF MY LIFE POUNDING HIM AFTER HIM IN HONOR OF THE BABY JESUS. OR WHATEVER. >> James: I AM PRETTY SURE THIS WASN'T THE BABY JESUS. OTHERWISE, THAT CRUCIFIXION TAKES A DARK TURN. IT'S THAT TIME. IT'S TIME TO GIVE AMERICA WHAT THEY NEED AND DESIRE. IT IS TIME FOR THE NEWS. THE PENTAGON IS SCRAMBLING TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF ONE OF THE MOST HIGH-PROFILE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEAKS IN DECADES. MORE THAN 50,000 CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HAVE NOW BEEN LEAKED TO VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. IT'S UNKNOWN WHO OBTAINED THE DOCUMENTS, WHO LEAKED THEM ONLINE, OR IF THEY'VE BEEN ALTERED IN ANY WAY AT ALL. BUT BESIDES THOSE MINOR DETAILS, THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THIS IS? THE PRESIDENT IS 80 YEARS OLD. HE PROBABLY CLICKED ONE OF THOSE FAKE AMAZON EMAILS WHILE HE WAS ON HIS WORK COMPUTER. BANG, THAT'S HOW THIS HAPPENS. TODAY, THE WHITE HOUSE HOSTED ITS ANNUAL EASTER EGG ROLL ON THE SOUTH LAWN. AND THIS YEAR, THEY EVEN UNVEILED A NEW EASTER BUNNY. HERE'S THE NEW BUNNY RIGHT HERE. THERE HE IS. THEY NEEDED A NEW ONE BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSE EASTER BUNNY IS CURRENTLY SERVING NINE YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE JANUARY 6 RIOT. ONCE AGAIN, THIS YEAR'S THEME WAS \"EGG-UCATION.\" ALTHOUGH BIDEN ALSO MADE TIME TO ADDRESS \"THE EGG-CONOMY\" AND HAVE I GOT? >> Reggie: SIX MORE, HOPEFULLY. THAT'S IT? >> James: IT'S EGG-CITING. \"SOCIAL S-EGG-CURITY?\" LOOK AT THAT PICTURE, THE EASTER BUNNY. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE A BLOW FOR VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS TO SEE THAT SOMEONE IN AN EASTER BUNNY COSTUME HAS GOTTEN CLOSER TO BIDEN THAN SHE HAS DURING HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY. I THINK THEY HAVE MADE THE MISTAKE HERE WITH THIS BUNNY. THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TRADITIONAL BROWN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BROWN FUR. PETER RABBIT VIBES. >> DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE PETER RABBIT VIBES? >> James: STILL AVAILABLE ON BLU-RAY, DVD, AND DOWNLOAD. MOVING ON. OVER THE WEEKEND, DONALD TRUMP MADE HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE BEING& ARRESTED. IN MIAMI. HERE HE IS, SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW WITH MIKE TYSON, KID ROCK, AND UFC PRESIDENT DANA WHITE. LOOK, YOU CELEBRATE THE LORD'S RESURRECTION YOUR WAY, LET TRUMP CELEBRATE HIS WAY. IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THINGS WHEN MY FIRST REACTION LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE IS, \"WHY IS MIKE TYSON HANGING OUT WITH SUCH A BAD CROWD?\" THAT'S RIGHT, MIKE TYSON, KID ROCK, DONALD TRUMP, AND DANA WHITE. IT'S THE MOUNT RUSHMORE OF [SHUDDERING] AND DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? OVER THE WEEKEND. OVER THE WEEKEND, SOME FANS WERE EJECTED FROM A LIVE THEATER MUSICAL PERFORMANCE OF \"THE BODYGUARD,\" AFTER LOUDLY SINGING ALONG TO \"I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.\" NOW, WE'VE GOT FOOTAGE FROM THE INCIDENT. YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING, BUT BELIEVE ME YOU CAN HEAR IT. OKAY, BUT HOW WAS THE REST OF THE BACHELORETTE WEEKEND? THAT'S HOW FAST THINGS CAN CHANGE. THEY WENT FROM SINGING THE BODYGUARD TO BEING TACKLED BY ONE. AND FINALLY, DOES EVERYONE REMEMBER BILLY McFARLAND, THE CREATOR OF FYRE FESTIVAL, WHO WAS SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR FRAUD? WELL, GUESS WHAT. LAST NIGHT HE TWEETED: \"FYRE FESTIVAL TWO IS FINALLY HAPPENING. TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE INVITED.\" TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE INVITED. I LIVE MY LIFE BY ONE SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY. IF JA RULE IS OUT, I'M OUT. IT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. FYRE FESTIVAL TWO PROMISES GREAT MUSIC, A PARTY ATMOSPHERE. PLUS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR MULTIPLE DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT HOW IT TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER. HAVE YOU HEARD THE LINEUP? A BTS COVER BAND, A CARDBOARD CUTOUT OF BEYONCE, AND STEVE FROM \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\" BAND. AND THAT ISN'T BILLY McFARLAND'S ONLY BIG IDEA. TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO THE VENUE, HE'S ALSO STARTING A CRUISE LINE IT'S CALLED \"TITANIC 2. HEY, IT CAN'T SINK TWICE!\" AND THAT'S THE NEWS!

      "page_content": "very very sweet good show today Brendan  hunts here coach beard coach beard on  Ted lasso oh yeah you you did you have  any memorable coaches when you were at  school yeah I have like my freshman year  football coach was this dude who played  like honestly like when people wore  leather helmets right so he would go on  like long rambling stories that didn't  go anywhere and then we would have to  like get him back on track so you're  like  [Applause]  yeah  that was your catch did you play any  sports in school reg I was just uh  thinking about that  uh  yes you did what did you play I played  football junior high high school uh-huh  yeah any good what position I well in  high school uh I just wanted to like  experience to say that I played High  School uh football but I so I chose um I  played a Right Guard because there was a  deodorant at the time yeah  my jersey number was 69.  and uh  yeah and I didn't know any of the plays  so I would always ask the nose guard as  we as we would break from the Huddle as  we were walking to the line I would ask  him what I'm supposed to do and he hated  it yeah I bet you you actually I don't  even know if you remember this very  early in the show I think even perhaps  before we'd even launched yeah it always  been my theory that I was born in the  wrong country and actually when I  watched The Blind Side I was like  I was like oh my God this this kid is me  I got a good awareness and I'm light on  my toes yeah that's all they kept saying  light on the toes good awareness I was  like had I been and I was very openly  going have I been born in America I'm  it's almost certain I would have been  the number two or three draft pick yeah  no question I think I've known you for  like two months and I said and you said  no way you wouldn't be able to do it and  I said I'm telling you right now and you  said all right and you got down in a  stance we went like we were in it we  were in the office we were right outside  of the office kitchen we were on carpet  I can block you we got down and he just  pounded me into a wall and I was like  okay yeah you're right that's not it's  not my Sport and it really crushed  all beef baby yeah  100 kosher beef right there that's all  that is  everybody  I look good though right I think this  should have been I was good at football  but this should have been a sign I  didn't have a future in it because  everybody else on the team everybody  else when they took their football  pictures they would they'd be like  yeah  a very serious Stone series dead serious  and then like I went down and like  kneeled down and I was like hey  [Laughter]  what could have been it's that time it's  time for the news  and officials in New York City were  prepared today for a possible indictment  of Donald Trump and any resulting  protests with 36 000 uniformed police  officers standing by in Manhattan tell  you what I bet Trump's ready to defund  the police now  6 000 cops  cops 36 000 in uniform now this might  sound extreme but it's standard practice  for any former presidents who are about  to be arrested for paying hush money to  porn stars that's  ugly always been the way the NYPD is  preparing for the worst meanwhile  Melania is sat at Mar-A-Lago like please  don't put him under house arrest please  don't put him under house anything but  house arrest  tell you what I'll tell you what  I consider house arrests to be the  absolute dream scenario  the dream scenario isn't it oh I'd love  to but I I'm under house arrest  Dude tell me who I have to manslaughter  because I  foreign  s are on a retreat in Orlando this week  to discuss policy and talk up their  agenda but they're frustrated because so  far they're mostly getting pulled away  to discuss Trump yeah not fun is it  having to having to constantly talk  about Donald Trump welcome to my life  for the last six years  Republicans are annoyed that they have  to focus on inconsequential things like  their former president being charged  with crimes when what they want to do is  focus on serious important issues like  drag queens reading in libraries  conducted by two Harvard professors over  a 25-year time period found the the  marriage could help women live longer  being married leads to a healthier  lifestyle more optimism and a greater  sense of purpose  you can just see husbands at home  everywhere now like me sitting here on  this couch is the healthiest thing that  ever happened to you babe  this helps win live longer Crazy  longer happier lives unless of course  that marriage falls into the very small  percentage that end in an episode of  Dateline then it's  according to the study marriage  increases lifespan even if you end up  getting divorced so like a lot of people  in La if you get remarried like four or  five times  you're practically Immortal  have you noticed a healthier approach to  your life since getting married  oh yeah absolutely yeah I mean night and  day it's night and days  for you yeah yeah I was on a collision  course your main in your main eating  hours were between midnight and three  yeah yeah I got all six thousand  calories in my day in that three-hour  Square by the way this is a tangent and  I'm doing I'm on medication right now so  if any of this is weird I apologize I  have an ear infection  I went to The Cheesecake Factory the  other day yeah and they put the cat I  know it's California state law but they  put the calorie count on the menu at the  Cheesecake Factory  stop it yeah  [Applause]  stop that yeah  it's called The Cheesecake Factory what  did you think what did we think we were  getting there no one's sitting down and  going oh let's just grab a bite and then  going  oh we should leave  there are items so there are like  combinations of food that you can get at  the Cheesecake Factory with an amount of  calories is is four digits it's oh yeah  yeah easy easy four digits more calories  than I made in money a year before I  started working here yeah the I don't  need to know I don't need to be a  scientists in New Jersey had to spend  their whole lives making the chemicals  for this to taste like a chicken fajita  so let me like  give them a break leave me alone I agree  I like it I like this thought  and finally Dodge just unveiled the last  gas-powered muscle car that they will  ever release before their factories are  all converted to make electric vehicles  it's a 2023 Dodge Challenger that  they're calling the last of the rumbling  cars  I love how Dodge is all sentimental  about it like hey babe  let's pollute the air one last time  together what do you say  Dodge is converting entirely to Electric  it's having an impact everywhere  actually I just saw this ad for a new  summer blockbuster that's coming out the  quiet and the responsible and  then  [Applause]  [Music]",

it's time for  over the weekend Donald Trump made the  shocking announcement that he expects to  be arrested on Tuesday you know it's bad  when a former president announces that  he's going to be arrested  and the general response is for which  crime  this is related  to the New York grand jury investigating  Trump's hush money payments to Stormy  Daniels so if you're keeping track  that's two times Stormy Daniels has  screwed Donald Trump New York City New  York City  New York City is already bracing for  unrest after Trump urged his supporters  to quote protest take our nation back of  course Trump urged his followers to  protest in New York like what else is he  going to urge them to do he'd be like oh  go and see Ben Platt in parade  it just opened a magnificent reviews on

you have a big weekend  I was it was uh yeah  here's the thing this story it turns out  Trump may have just pulled Tuesday out  of thin air the grand jury hasn't even  voted to indict with more testimony  given before the grand jury today I like  that even Trump's going I don't need to  wait until this is over to know that I'm  [Applause]  I'm guilty man I'm guilty as Sin  got to be something bigger going on here  it's Tuesday melania's birthday  is that what it is  I actually think I actually think this  whole plot of him going I'm going to get  arrested on Tuesday once they don't  arrest him on Tuesday he can then go see  they haven't got enough evidence  according to a new study so-called dad  jokes help kids develop into healthy  adults the study suggests that when  fathers embarrass their children with  unfunny jokes it teaches kids how to  overcome awkwardness  it also gives every child something to  talk about in therapy that's what it is  Dad's telling bad jokes helps turn kids  into healthy adults meanwhile dad's  playing saxophone around the house helps  turn kids into whatever this is I don't  know  by the way  why do melons have weddings  because they counterlope  there you go just me doing my part  to make America a better place for the  future  you are gonna be  wait when you become a father you are  going to be the absolute king of dad  jokes  oh yeah I can't wait I'm already  brushing up two muffins sitting in an  oven one muffin turns to the other and  says hot enough for you and the other  muffin says oh my God a talking muffin  foreign  [Music]  [Applause]  study Americans spent nearly 14 billion  dollars last year while shopping drunk  I hope this only refers to online  shopping no one should be black out  drunk in the middle of a Home Depot you  know hey look here's what I'm going to  say sometimes drunk me likes to get  sober me a little gift  okay and when a giant slip and slide  shows up along with 10 Super Soakers I'm  like wow  he gets me  I mean I will say  online shopping is way better than the  things we used to do when we drank too  much like in our 20s it was like oh God  oh God I got smashed I texted my ex last  night and now we're like oh God I  blacked out  and I ordered a milk frother from Amazon  you know Steve can you tell us about  your drunk uh Amazon orders oh I bet  you've got a cavalcade strapping I don't  know if this is gonna make it to TV but  I dated a woman that was half my age oh  God  and she was very kinky and uh we used to  drink wine and smoke a lot of dope and  be online on sex toy stores and and just  she'd be like I want that I want that I  want that I want that I was making some  money  so  and so I ordered everything but I was  blackout and then for the

there's gonna be a lot of  things I'm gonna think about  finished this show  regrets things we didn't oh I didn't get  to do that we didn't get to do that and  I feel like the one that will hang over  all of them is that  is that we we barely even  scratched the surface  of what a kinky bastard Steve is  and if you hear about this the  scientific Community got very excited  recently over a photo that they saw of a  rare goblin shark the goblin shark was  photographed for the very first time in  the Mediterranean Sea they were  incredibly excited until it turned out  that the shark was just a plastic toy  scientists first became suspicious when  the fish started singing Don't Worry Be  Happy  skeptic cited numerous reasons that they  think that it's a fake shark including  the shape of the jaw the incorrect  number of gills and the fact it says  made in China on the fins  and finally we wanted to show you this  during the morning weather report on St  Patrick's Day an interaction went viral  after the meteorologist remarked that  she was holding a remote control in each  hand which led her to say this  Thursday partly sunny skies and 57. and  to another woman who likes to be

the Stars and you said  that you got so inspired you might want  to compete on Dancing With the Stars is  that true can you dance I would love to  learn how to dance yeah and you know the  show's amazing right and so it's just  incredible the way they transform into  these prolific dances and you know I was  a hot mess you know I used to fly home  from here Friday night get there  Saturday afternoon straight to L street  watch the live show and then jump back  on a Sunday but uh I would love to do it  before I get too old just so I can move  properly without any hip replacement on  the first dance I'd love to see you I  really really would it's just the  tanning and the sequences and the Lycra  and oh sure yeah seemed like you got a  real problem with the tanning yeah  and also I've got size 15 feet that is  true yeah they're a big boats yes what  about you could we ever see you on on  Dancing With the Stars have you ever do  it yeah you never know how bad my career  will get  [Applause]  uh  anything for sure  um uh  a good dancer per se but I am good at  weddings I'm like oh really yes I'm a  fun wedding guest has to see that in you  yeah but I mean I have like a certain  Rhythm on the floor it's kind of like  um someone who like uh just took a  nitrous balloon at a dead show kind of  got a nice Groove yeah I'm good in a  horror uh  and I feel like I drink enough that I  like no one else is gonna be embarrassed  yeah yeah you're right you create space  for other people I give everyone their  room to grow yeah yeah I do think that  should be the first episode of Dancing  With the Stars it should be no Partners  No it should just be people dancing on  their own yes for three minutes  it is hard sometimes when you're at a  wedding and you're like I had a few  drinks you're like I do want to dance  like do you remember yeah you're like  okay  yeah we're gonna walk down the aisle one  day there's gonna be the first dance and  there's gonna be the parents dance so I  just want to do it properly yeah yeah I  just you think you'd do like one of  those super choreographed like I would  work my ass off to get that thing  absolutely now I swear it's gotta be  like a Saturday Night Fever all in white  and I'll just wait I would let rip the  idea of this  oh yes  now Adam I don't I think it's going to  be a while until you are in a in a  position career-wise where you have to  start considering uh Dancing with the  Stars because you've just shot this new  show I'm very excited for this with  Arnold Schwarzenegger now how was it  being with him did you get alone time we  do you think this is the start of a  lifelong friendship  um  no  [Applause]  I don't think we'll be well maybe we'll  be friends but uh I think that he he  thought he thought I was amusing right  to him he's like he like you know when  when you like go over to a friend's  house and they have like a cat that  chases a laser and and you watch it for  a second you're like all right that's  cool what are we doing today like I was  the cat with a laser to arm right I mean  he was like oh all right that's here  today what's going on right  but but we definitely  um like I would I would try to break the  ice with him by trying to speak his  language and so I hit the gym sometimes  you know I I I  would be like you know asking specific  questions like when you do an Arnold  press which they named after you is it  like this range of motion he would  instantly start laughing right  and I would be like why are you laughing  at me you know I want to know this  information he'd be like come on why do  you care  [Laughter]  now I got a congratulate you on your  brilliant newest show next level Chef  it's such a clever idea it's so I love  this whole idea for a for a cooking  competition for anyone who doesn't know  tell us all about it so it's three  Kitchens on top of her you've got this  amazing sort of uh Top Flight amazing  three Michelin star top kitchen middle  is like a banqueting kitchen and then  underneath that you've got this basement  is this sort of dingy dirty kitchen with  dilapidated in sort of equipment and  nothing working and dull lights and just  yeah zero in there and the chefs have to  move their way this platform descends  you've got 30 seconds to grab  ingredients then you cook your way to  the top and to get to that next level  status so yeah super super cool it's so  good and the people on the bottom level  what I love is that they they're left  with kind of the worst food but actually  it's kind of amazing they managed to  make these gourmet meals like if you are  such a such an acclaimed Chef if you had  ten dollars uh to spend on you could  only go to a 7-Eleven right what would  you make from that that's hard yeah but  what would it be we're not going to  spend that money  um  so I would go for like the instant Mash  powdered mash and take you know  rehydrate it turn it into something  delicious like a gnocchi nice get some  chopped steak do like a Philly chopped  steak fried eggs from 7-Eleven yeah and  then get like a sports drink reduce it  down and do like a gas streak so it'd be  like a sort of Philly steak fresh  knocking from the pound the Gatorade  reduction yes yeah wow like a gastric is  I don't no no no no um like the farm no  no no no no no it's not a gastric band a  gastric is like it's like this sort of  vinegary delicious acidic reduction  right beautiful I'll get that in a 9.99  wow what about you Adam you got 10 bucks  in a 7-Eleven what do you what do you do  I get the biggest barrel of Nyquil  laughs  now go now I want to talk about this was  a great video going around that you went  to see Adele perform at her show in  Vegas have a look at this  [Music]  it's such an incredible show uh what's  he like  what's it like going to a concert with  you when Adele walks over to you what  are you thinking you singing along at  the top of your voice I was trying to  sing and then obviously when we clocked  she came over to say hello I'm thinking  don't have that mic please do not you  know sometimes when they go oh yeah I'm  like please don't do that so do that she  gives it to the audience sometimes at  the beginning she'll say um  but it was just like oh my God no no no  no no no  she's coming so I was like uh super  excited to see it I think we'd all like  to  we'd all like to know what it would  sound like  [Applause]  so listen and you're gonna you'll know  the lyrics so just let's hit play and  then you just you're gonna come in on  the chorus okay

we started  to him we said wouldn't it be great if  when the when the guest comes out of the  curtain if the audience did this but  what we didn't do was tell the guests  and I forget who the guest

balloon off the coast of South  Carolina on Saturday I know this is very  very serious I know it's a serious  situation but you have to admit  the fact that it's a balloon  [Applause]  it does make it feel quite silly doesn't  it  on the bright side from now on when it's  your your kid's birthday balloon pops  and they're upset you can just go no it  was a Chinese spy balloon to me the  Chinese can't spawn us anymore you're a  Patriots  China says the American government has  overreacted I'm sorry but if you wanted  everyone to smile about this at least  send us balloons in funny shapes  of course right here in Los Angeles the  Grammys were held last night did  everybody watch  absolutely brilliant show as always  things kicked off with some incredible  looks on the red carpet lizzo wore this  spectacular floral cape  lizzo Red Riding Hood  [Music]  the outfit's amazing it  you know like camouflage you'd use if  you needed to sneak into Elton John's  house  unnoticed here's what Harry Styles wore  on the carpet look at that  [Applause]  can look good in that  if you saw me walking down the road  wearing that you'd think I'd just failed  out of clown School  now if you look carefully you'll see he  only exposed half of each nipple and  that's how you can tell it's a formal  occasion  did everyone say did you see Shania  Twain here she is in a black and white  polka dot suit  with a matching oversized hat I gotta  tell you I saw that I was like yeah that  actually does impress me much  I love it look at it she looks like  Beetlejuice on mushrooms  the big look of the night last night was  sparkly silver outfits Beyonce lizzo  first lady Jill Biden and Harry Styles  all took their lead from the fashion  icon that is the Cybermen from Doctor  Who  now all of that silver was actually  specially designed to reflect any Radars  on Chinese balloons  jealous Chris Martin he looked so  comfortable I was like honestly I was  like as I saw him  I saw him and I looked at what I was  wearing and I sort of when I was at home  I got dressed I was at home I looked in  the mirror and I was like yeah  you know what I mean you know when you  look and you're like oh yeah  I look pretty Chic then I got there and  I was actually around like cool people  who are Chic and realized that I was  dressed like a geography teacher  simmer down  simmer down  simmer down  I will not open this envelope until  everyone has calmed down  then I saw Chris Martin he looked so  coming he looked he looks like he looks  very excited to spend the quarter that  the tooth fairy's just left him  Chris Martin looks like he's trying to  pretend he's not upset that I just told  him I don't have a minute to discuss  Greenpeace  could you uh could you pull off any of  those outfits if you were going to  Grandma's what would you wear  ah no I look like I coach Middle School  football I can't I can't wear cool  outfits no no I if I wore any of those  silver ones I'd look like a baked potato  there's just no Chris Martin no  he's a rock star so you can dress like  that he looks like he fell asleep at  Staples Center and then was interrupted  by the Grammys yeah  [Applause]  I love it because now what Chris has  done there is he's lent fully into  artists exemption yeah  he's nominated should I mean yeah he's  on the biggest selling tour in the world  right now he's nominated he's like oh  well I won yeah right I'll come but just  you know I'm coming but I'm wearing the  Hat that's gonna be  yeah at some point the money the fame  that you know what I mean like the the  people you want to have sex with  throwing themselves at you at some point  that's got to wear off but the ability  to wear whatever the hell you want  correct whenever that's gotta stay that  stays good forever right yeah you are  absolutely right yeah  of course last night Beyonce was the big  winner but she was actually stuck in  traffic and missed her first televised  Award of the night I don't care how much  traffic there was missing your Grammy  win is an automatic one star deduction  for that Uber driver you know it is  as someone who lives in La I did feel  for her traffic on the 405 is actually  one of the only things that can break  your soul  is there a historic night Beyonce won  four Grammys bringing her total number  of wins to 32 making her the most  decorated artist in Grammy history  I think that's it now  I may not say I honestly think this is  this is the I think people are finally  going to just start listening to Beyonce  and giving her a chance you know Beyonce  surpassed George salty the  hungarian-born classical conductor who  died in 1997 and let me tell you the  salty Hive was Furious last night  there were some amazing performances  here's Sam

grandparents timeshare  [Music]  what a career though you know what this  means  it's both me and Tommy two Elite  athletes retiring this year in Peak  physical condition  at the end of the video by uh Brady got  a little emotional sadly without  football he's going to have to fill his  days with nothing but being insanely  Rich accomplished fit handsome and  single  now I'm stopping the show in April I'm  going to like retire do you think I  should do a Brady stop the show returns  just immediately come back out of  retirement in May I should do that  [Applause]  I I I love you I think it I think that  you do great if you did that but I think  I would urge you to look at how it went  for Tom Brady when he did that and you  know he didn't go to the playoffs he got  hurt a couple times and he got a divorce  and I think that  I wouldn't maybe follow that path you  know  yeah  and a school worker in Illinois has now  been charged with stealing 1.5 million  dollars worth of chicken wings after  purchasing them with school funds the  thief was considered armed and dangerous  meanwhile the chickens were considered  disarmed and Furious foreign  like  you ordered 1.5 million dollars worth of  chicken wings you steal the 1.5 million  dollars worth of chicken wings  like what's the next move what do you do  I just hope you run  you right I have no concept of how many  chicken wings you can get for 1.5  million dollars what would that even  look like  [Music]  thank you  [Music]  okay and get ready to argue because  according to a compilation of expert  reviews one website has compiled an  unofficial top five list of the best  candy bars of all time Snickers takes  the top spot followed by Twix Reese's  Peanut Butter Cups take five and KitKat  and this list has just made my top five  list of most bullet lists  this is  an outrage  these are all American candy bars you  can't say the list is the best of all  time and only put American foods on them  this is like having an American baseball  championship and calling it The World  Series  Super Bowl and declaring yourself the  world's  what's your top five top five of all  time candy bars go number one  Butterfinger  yeah yeah we got some people  that's the most engaged you've ever been  in the show ever  go on number one Butterfinger number two  take five it was on their list  chocolate it's one of America's best  candy bars number three I gotta go  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups all right  yeah a little non-traditional but it's a  peanut butter cup it's fun number four  Twix it's all in the mix they're fun to  eat it's a little bit of a party a  little chocolate it's a little chewy  Little Mix it around yeah you can mix it  around you do a bite and then you do it  you know you pull it away yeah you can  just do the caramel go around the sides  it's a party for everyone several  different ways to eat it and number five  might be a little controversial but I  like a Hershey's cookies oh cream  cookies and cream stuff Hershey's itself  garbage Hershey's cookies and cream why  are you only All American candies you've  been  to the island of the of the greatest  chocolate ever do fruit snacks count  because like I'll throw a Percy Pig in  there I think we're just on chocolate  here I think we're just on chocolate my  problem with British candy bars is I  can't remember any of the names like you  could make up 20 of them and 19 could be  real and the one I would never be able  to pick it up  uh reg what's your top five  I do like I do like Snickers yeah I have  to say that you know I've got no problem  with this knickers I've got no beef with  it it's fine uh peanut M M's correct I I  like it's just you to me that's a  universal that one kind of universally  just works everywhere but um except for  the people they're like ah anaphylaxis  but uh  but uh if we're going into British  territory oh man what's the uh the  galaxy galaxy  [Applause]  well you know a Dairy Milk a Dairy Milk  which is really a Cadbury's dairy milk  yeah and then you've got a whole nut you  know you got a whisper yeah double  decker right there's a whole world oh  your candy bars sound like nicknames for  the funny kid in class oh I'm sorry  we're not as good as Butterfinger  and finally according to a new study 85  percent of senior citizens now play  video games at least once a week many of  these grandparent games say they first  picked up the console during the  covid-19 lockdown and now use them  regularly to keep their mind active I  love this I love I love I love some  fresh meat to destroy in FIFA  in the same study 36 of elderly people  say they play video games every day this  has also led to an increased demand in  retirement communities for flaming hot  Cheetos and Mountain Dew  in fact it's so popular companies are  now making games aimed especially at  seniors there's Red Dead hypertension  Super Mario mobility scooter  of course Grand Theft Auto you left your  blinkers on  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  get it back  [Applause]",

I  want you to know I'm being deadly  serious  is everything okay  yeah for the most part okay  so you've just sort of given up on that  little fun Trope you know  I think perhaps Thursday there may be  something  Nick call the network now that that  information is out there Thursday is  going to be a ratings gangbuster  I don't know okay should we try it again  it's time for the news  foreign  Administration has announced that they  will end the covid Health Emergency on  May 11th to which most of the country  was like oh yeah that's right covid yeah  the timing makes sense might as well  squeeze in one more spring break Public  Health Emergency For Old Times Sake you  know the administration plans to end the  public health emergency in May I know  that's why I'm stepping down at the end  of April you know what this means we did  it guys let it be known the lately show  ended covid  foreign  moving on it came out today that the FBI  searched Joe Biden's former Think Tank  office back in mid-november despite the  administration repeatedly saying that it  has been transparent about classified  documents and searches this one wasn't  disclosed until now if you ask me the  White House has been very transparent  you know they are willing to admit to  anything as soon as it comes out  laughs this happened to Biden's Think  Tank you know where he Ponders the  weighty questions of the world like how  do they get the entire model ship inside  that little bottle  The Raid happened in November now in  Biden's defense that time around  Thanksgiving and Christmas it's always  nuts we all lose track of time it would  be really easy to forget about the FBI  searching your think tank in other  political news Donald Trump is now suing  journalist Bob Woodward for almost 50  million dollars Trump says that he never  agreed to allow his taped interviews  with Woodward to be sold as an audio  book Trump must wake up every morning  have a stretch and just think who should  I sue today  he's also suing Simon and Schuster and  his parent company Paramount Global  which I should tell you is also the  parent company of CBS meaning that they  own this show so listen up you come for  Paramount you're coming for me buddy  okay not just me you're coming for young  Sheldon old Sheldon the middle Sheldon  every Sheldon you don't want the smoke  I want it  and this morning Congressman George  Santos has been facing calls to resign  after lying about his background told  Republican colleagues in a closed-door  meeting that he will recuse himself from  serving on house committees mainly  because he's going to be too busy  performing with lizzo and Bad Bunny at  the Grammys  Santos made the announcement to  colleagues during a closed door meeting  here's my question why do they bother  closing the door if they're just going  to come out and tell us what happened  this is a closed door meeting and then  they come and go you're never going to  believe  78 of Voters in his district want Santos  to resign from other from Office the  other 22 percent just love to watch a  messy [ __ ]  what do you think he's going to do I  think he's I think he naturally he's  going to be on the male singer isn't he  yeah for sure and even if he isn't he'll  tell people that that's him yeah do you  think you'll do the masking I feel like  that's the next that oh Dancing with the  Stars I think he's more Dancing with the  Stars guy you think he's a bigger bigger  dancing yeah a lot more Face Time more  dancing right better outfits yeah well  he choreographed that new Elvis movie so  exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah  and a six-year-old boy in Michigan is  making headlines apparently his dad let  him use his phone to play a game but the  boy ended up opening his father's  GrubHub app and ordered a thousand  dollars worth of food according to his  father the doorbell just kept ringing  and cars just kept coming  this is true among other items the kid  ordered a thousand dollars worth of  jumbo shrimp salads shawarma chicken  Pita sandwiches ice cream and chili  cheese fries there's no denying it this  kid is going to have the best Super Bowl  party on the Block  everybody  when he told his dad what happened his  dad was like oh GrubHub  thank God I thought it was something  else  it's brilliant really it's pretty like  order a big screen TV and his parents  could just return it order a trip to  Disney World they could cancel it you  order a thousand dollars with worth of  food you're gonna end up eating a  thousand dollars worth of food I  actually think this kid is smart now  because if you ordered all of that food  from one place the restaurant might  become suspicious might call if you  spread it out over multiple locations  you know what I mean that's what I  learned when I found out when I found  there Josh Groban's credit card in the  couch over there  what if you think about this kid is he a  criminal or a mastermind Mastermind or a  criminal mastermind quick criminal  mastermind on CBS now I  he's a genius he's a hero I wish I feel  like the future's in good hands I used  to worry that China would overtake us  but as long as we got kids like this  we're gonna be okay  have you ever had that  have you ever done that thing where you  order you you order like a delivery to  your house  and you've ordered the food just for you  and then you look in the bag and they've  put in like eight sets of utensils  and you're like ah yeah  am I right they they heard this order  and thought  well that sounds like it's for eight  people  I did not I did ninety dollars at Taco  Bell once because wow  couldn't you have bought a Taco Bell  I was in like West L.A at our like with  some friends and then we got an Uber we  got we had a lot to drink got in the  Uber headed back to my house in like Far  East L.A and I like ordered some Taco  Bell Postmates on the way but I was too  drunk to remember to pick like the Taco  Bell close to my house so I ordered from  a Taco Bell that was like in Santa  Monica and then they delivered 25 miles  to the East and then it showed up and we  housed it and then woke up the next  morning and there was one burrito left  with a bite in the middle  well you know what this means somebody  somebody at that party was a psychopath  yeah somebody I I saw something just  this weekend that I have never seen in  my life before and it made me look at my  daughter she's eight years old my  daughter Kerry I looked at her suddenly  and thought you are gonna do something  different because it's what she did on  Saturday afternoon  was she uh opened a Twix right and she  said two sticks and she straight up just  she just bit into the two fingers of the  Twix  like it was a Snickers  and then looked at me as if to go yeah  I think different I said I said Carrie  Carrie I've never seen anybody it tweaks  that way she said why wouldn't you eat a  Twix that way and I was like  [Music]  we got to get her on climate change  well look  look dying yeah but she's gonna try  drugs yeah  [Applause]  and finally have you seen this a video  of an anteater has gone viral because it  has confused many people on Twitter with  lots of people wondering if the anteater  has two heads have a look  now the craziest part is it's not just  any second head it's a tiny Panda's head  look at that look  now people on Twitter were really  confused which is nice because usually  they're just you know outraged uh  it turns out this is actually normal all  giant anteaters have Furry Paws on one  of their legs right that's what it is  the heads here and they have a furry paw  here and it really confused the internet  which apparently doesn't have access to  the internet and

over there  it was just this all three of them went  I haven't I I if you listen to it Have  you listened to it the bit on his book  where Prince Harry's book where he's  talking about is what does he call it a  todger  do you do anyone hear any Americans ever  refer to their  penis is a todger yeah nothing never  [Applause]  never  yeah told you now we we'll say like like  or Willie I mean I had such high hopes  for this show I did I did every day  every day I walked down I stand behind  the curtain I genuinely I promise you I  stood there tonight I thought  I thought we've only got like  49 of these to go  you gotta soak up every second of this  James you've got to soak it all up let's  really let's really go out there and be  let's be the show you want it to be and  within  he doesn't know what day of the week it  is  45 seconds  we are discussing  UK and U.S names for penises  can you speak with us I love this  one  are we even allowed to say these on on  TV nickel will they be beeped do you  have to beepish long or you can say  that's a really good question I feel  like that one might that one might pass  I think we'd get away with  long you get away with but no  interesting when we go off on these  tangents is I have to come back to the  story  let's see how that plays out  you know Biden loves these trips  [Applause]  to be clear the stories about Biden  visiting it doesn't matter  it's mainly coming here to make everyone  feel better about the weather by telling  them about worst storms from the past  it's like you think this is bad I  remember the winter storms of 52 and let  me tell you it was wetter than an  otter's pocket  foreign  pocket obviously a different euphemism  did you see this  after 30 years on the run it's Italy's  most Wanted mafia boss has been arrested  in Sicily I didn't even know until this  point the being a mob boss was illegal  in Italy I just thought it was a  completely viable career option like  dentist or Vespa salesman  he was reportedly detained in a private  medical clinic the doctor was like we're  going to take your blood pressure so go  ahead just put this cuff on your arm and  then put this cuff around your wrist and  we've got him we've got it  here he is after the arrest he's being  charged with racketeering extortion and  worst of all impersonating the Ikea  monkey  and in a major breakthrough scientists  have for the very first time  successfully demonstrated a way to  prevent dangerous lightning strikes by  actually steering them away using lasers  they did so by firing lasers at  thunderclouds from the top of a Swiss  mountain  I feel like this is something like my  son when he's hyped up on sugar would  try to write a story about he'd be like  people control lightning with lasers  from a mountain  it could help in stopping lightning  strikes it's all a bit technical  scientists said the key is finding the  perfect storm cloud aiming the laser  beam just right and then making sure  that you make that pew pew  make that sound when you shoot the laser  here's an interesting study according to  researchers being in a bad mood can  actually make you better at work  apparently when people are in a negative  mood they're more careful and analytical  this is why Winnie is such a valued  member of the team  thank you  imagine that if you're in a bathroom you  get home and your spouse is like how was  work honey you're like it was fine I had  a really productive day  people are in a negative mood to do  better at work do you think this is true  I don't know if this is true  I I don't know I've I've never been  angry at work  foreign  do you think this is true though that  people are in a bad I don't think this  is true if this was true it would take  like 20 seconds to renew your driver's  license at the DMV  thanks for that laugh babe audible laugh  from Pete it's number three  on show 1150.  who in the band gets in the worst moods  me really yeah I don't think I've seen  you in a bad mood okay  you've seen you don't see it it's just  there you know like it's it gets done  you can feel it okay you've seen him  break a guitar on his birthday and that  was in a good mood  yeah you never crossed me if someone was  in a bag it's working then yeah it is  the facade works  we wanted to tell you about this a woman  in Mexico is being hailed online as a  genius because she got a tattoo on her  arm which actually launches her Spotify  playlist so that she can request music  from a DJ have a look  [Music]  I love it it's amazing incredible the  woman is being hailed online as a genius  and by her parents at home as an utter  disappointment  she's only a genius I think if her  playlist is just track after track of  Mambo Number Five  but now in  the song at the club all you have  can you scan my arm I'm saying can you  scan my arm  we need your camera with your camera  give me a phone you've got to update  your Spotify app it's not hard to know  what forget it don't worry about it and  that that's the news  we'll be back everybody  [Music]",

small  moment in my life where I lived next  door to Gwyneth Paltrow  what what happened in London yeah  when she was with Chris Martin they  lived in a very very very  amazing big house  and I lived in a small house just here  next door and uh and periodically I'd  sequence Paltrow in the garden and that  was that's the end of the story of  I've realized right now this isn't my  best anecdote  about anything actually but yeah did you  forward your friendship at all anything  like that  does it sound like we did no  I will say this Gwyneth Paltrow just  text me true story I noticed as I put my  phone on to charge in here should I read  it yes please James  oh no I can't  I put it in he said I'm so excited to be  here I loved mammals which is a TV show  I'm in on Amazon Prime video it's

you think we should be setting up a  Lifestyle brand yes like thank you madam  the other side of this what would we  call it what would it be we should call  it droop  and we only sell erectile dysfunction  that's right  Brian could work is there  in doing a doing like famous men Brad  Pitt has a skincare  he's got a skincare line yeah has he  yeah is it just called be Brad Pitt and  that's  yeah I do think that is a big part of  Brad Pitt's skin being good yeah is that  it's on Brad Pitt's face if if Paul  Giamatti had a skincare line I'd sign up  for that because I'm like okay he's  doing something you know what I mean  correct yeah also I will say this Paul  Giamatti phenomenal skin great skin but  I take Paul giamatti's skin over Brad  Pitt's Brad Pitt's face okay to put that  skin on you'd like to drape Paul  giamatti's skin over a Brad Pitt's sort  of facial structure and that that's a  Lifestyle brand  it's that time it's time for the news  the news and this uh  what was that  the news  and this afternoon President Biden  traveled to Mexico City for a summit  with his fellow North American leaders  Mexican president obrador and Canadian  Prime Minister Trudeau the meeting is  traditionally known as The Three Amigos  Summit first item on the agenda was  coming up with a cooler nickname for  this Summit it's called The Three Amigos  Summit because you just know Joe Biden  is going to use the word Amigo at least  three times every minute  the leaders are going to discuss border  security immigration and trade policy  you know like Amigos  moving on at last there is a new Speaker  of the House Republican Kevin McCarthy  won the job in a dramatic 15th vote  early on Saturday morning after a  contentious four days and 14 failed  balance this is what happens when you  try to put someone named Kevin into a  position of power  things got a little crazy as voting  continued  continue Friday night Republican Mike  Rogers confronted Matt gates after he  refused to vote for McCarthy and had to  be restrained by another lawmaker  Republicans resorting to violence on the  house floor what a perfect way to honor  the two-year anniversary of January 6.  you just know the Bravo executives  Bravo Executives were looking at this  like guys  I think we might have a new franchise  meanwhile Democrats had nothing to do  but wait while the Republican majority  figured things out here's California  representative Katie Porter on Friday  reading a book on the house floor titled  the subtle art of not giving up  I kind of love it I do love it  because nothing says subtle like a  bright orange book with a matching shirt  and in an effort to sway votes to  McCarthy at one point represent Marjorie  Taylor green actually tried to pass her  phone to a fellow Republican with what  appeared to be Donald Trump's initials  on the screen yeah yeah that's how you  calm down a chaotic situation get Donald  Trump involved  the caller ID  the caller ID on the phone just says DT  and everyone's like she's calling Trump  we don't know that's Trump we don't know  she could easily just be calling Danny  Trejo  we're gonna need some coffee and donuts  we're gonna be here in a while  moving on did you see this yesterday  right wing supporters of Brazil's former  president ransacked the presidential  Palace Congress and Supreme Court  leaving a trail of Destruction in their  wake hmm I wonder where they got that  idea from  12  00 protesters were arrested and swiftly  removed it was a full Brazilian  over there  gone in one dramatic motion

from his family on whether or not he  could have a beard for his own wedding  have a look on stage you know you'll you  have to ask permission of the queen to  have a beard for your that's it to keep  the bird yeah  and I would feel very very different  without my beard and that's hard for  people to understand who have never  grown a beard but hopefully those beard  people out there will go yeah no I fully  get that I can understand  I love the tone to the camera  as he addresses the bearded community  tell me I just imagine some guy at home  watching this interview like yeah you  tell him h  in the same interview Prince Harry also  addressed losing his virginity in a  field behind a pub  you know there's you losing your  virginity I think you know apparently  sensitive viewers turn away now  um it's four lines or something right  [Laughter]  that's okay it happens to a lot of guys  the first time he does  in a field behind a pub that's one of  those things that's worse than the sum  of its parts  you lose you lose your virginity in a  field or in a pub right not great either  way in a field behind a bub that's  terrible isn't it  Prince Harry also discussed using drugs  in his younger years have a look there's  a fair amount of drugs  um  marijuana magic mushrooms cocaine I mean  that's gonna surprise people marijuana  magic mushrooms and cocaine  now just for American ears or in fact  anybody with ears cocaine is cocaine  I tell you what the last place I'd want  to be as a royal is high on mushrooms is  in the palace  I should be high on mushrooms walking  down a hallway pictures of all your  ancestors  start talking to you telling you where  to go what to do  and finally a Japanese man whose dream  was to quote looked like a real wolf  walking on hind legs

[ Cheers and applause ] That's right. That's right -- the start of the new year means Dry January has begun. Yeah. That's right. [ Audience boos ] It is the month when millions of Americans go a whole week without drinking. [ Laughter ] Also, today is January 6th. So don't forget to wish your one uncle a happy anniversary. [ Laughter ] Of course, right now, a major winter storm is slamming the U.S. with snow and ice stretching across most of the country. That's what every parent was looking forward to after two weeks at home with their kids. [ Laughter ] Snow day. Yep, over 60 million people are dealing with bitter cold temperatures. Here's how cold it is in New York City. The ball they dropped on New Year's Eve just went back up. -What? [ Laughter ] Indeed. -A lot of people are talking about this. New York City just became the first U.S. city to introduce congestion pricing, which is a $9 toll for anyone who drives into Midtown. [ Audience boos ] And if that doesn't earn enough money, they're going to introduce a swear jar in Brooklyn. -Ooh. [ Laughter ] -Meanwhile, for some vehicles, the toll is over $20. Yeah, or if you've got $20, you can just walk across the bridge and buy a brand-new Nissan LEAF. [ Laughter ] Some news from Washington -- yesterday during an event at the White House, President Biden brought a young man up on stage to sing him \"Happy Birthday,\" and, well, just watch this. -♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday [Mumbles] ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ -Yeah, well. -Alright. -Well, he's still got it. So that's good. [ Laughter ] [ Mumbles ] Listen to this. I read a new report that said President-elect Trump privately complains about how much Elon Musk is around. [ Laughter ] Yeah, today, Trump jumped into a broom closet to hide from Elon. And Melania was like, \"Hey, get your own spot!\" [ Laughter ] Yep, in two months, Trump and Elon went from \"Love Is Blind\" to \"Baby Reindeer.\" You know what I'm saying? Some more political news -- today, Congress convened to certify the results of the presidential election, and Vice President Harris oversaw the process. Yeah, Harris was like, \"And with that, my Dry January is over.\" [ Laughter ] Even more upsetting, a confused Biden then walked in and sang her \"Happy Birthday.\" [ Mumbled singing ] You go, \"Get him out of here. He's not even humming the --\" Guys, on Friday, the 119th Congress was officially sworn in, which means there are a bunch of brand-new members of the House of Representatives. We thought we'd take a minute to get to know some of them right now. -Oh. -Yeah. For instance, here's Mike Haridopolos... [ Laughter ] Up next, here's George Latimer... [ Laughter ] Up next here is Bob Onder... [ Laughter ] Next up here is Brad Knott... [ Laughter ] Up next, here's Rob Bresnahan... [ Laughter ] Next up, here's -- [ Rimshot ] [ Laughter continues ] -Wow! -Here's Riley Moore... [ Laughter ] And finally, here's Pat Harrigan... [ Laughter ] It's good to get to know some of these people. Just get to know them and understand them. [ Applause ] Yeah, guys, the 119th Congress just kicked off. It's a brand-new group of people. But luckily, Mark's made a quick song to help us get to know them all. Mark, take it away. -Thanks, Jimmy. The 119th Congress is an amazing group. They come from all over the country, and every single one of them is unique. Let's do this.

She is a social-media star who is currently making her Broadway debut in \"& Juliet,\" which is playing now at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre. Charli D'Amelio is joining us tonight!

[ Cheers and applause ] Come on! Guys, I didn't do -- I didn't do my -- I did my Wordle this morning, but I didn't do my Connections. -Really? -I didn't do -- Do you guys mind if we do Connections together right now? Is that okay? It's my favorite puzzle. I love doing it. It's time for \"Tonight Show Connections.\" Here we go. Let's do it. -♪ Tonight Show Connections ♪ ♪ La la la la la, oh, yeah ♪ -So the way it works, there are 16 random words or phrases.

You see anything there? -Yeah, I think I do. I see black. -Uh-huh. -I see yellow. -Yes. -Brown and red. -Okay. Of course. -Karate belts. Right? -What? -It's in karate. -Oh, karate belts. -Yeah. -Oh. -What did you think it was? -Colors. -Oh. [ Laughter ] -No. You're -- Yeah, that's right, karate belts. That's good. Let's see what it is. [ Ding! ] Yeah. Colors of the New York City snow. -Oh. [ Cheers and applause ] -I was close. Yeah. It's a match. So we got it. It wasn't -- It wasn't karate belts. That was a good connection. Interesting. Yeah. You got one, Quest? -Yeah, I think so. We got, uh -- What? McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and Arby's. -Yeah. Okay, good. That's obviously... -Fast-food restaurants. -Yeah. Of course. -Yeah. -Let's see what it is. [ Ding! ] Required experience for the next White House chef. Interesting. [ Laughter and applause ] Either way, it's a match. -Hey, it's a win. -Tariq, you want to play? -Okay, cool. -What do you got? -Drano, Windex. -Yeah. -Lysol and Tide. -Okay. -They're all cleaning products. -Yeah, that's -- I agree. They're all cleaning products. Let's see what the connection is. Or if it is a connection. Oh, it is. [ Ding! ] What people drink during Dry January just to feel something. [ Laughter ] -Wow. [ Applause ] -Alright, so that just leaves us with running, biking, swimming, and jogging. Let's see what that connection is. It is ways to get to the pharmacy to pick up your Ozempic.

Paul, \"Late Show\" band. -Yes. -Dave. -Yes. -You know, and then me. -No. -It's sad. -I thought you were gonna say then me. No, it's not sad. -No, it is. By the way, congratulations. I think we should congratulate Jimmy. 50 years as \"The Tonight Show\" host. -No, it's not. -That's unbelievable. -10 years. [ Cheers and applause ] -50 years. I remember being a kid and watching you. -No, you don't. [ Laughter ] -Being like, \"Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.\" -No, no, you never -- Did you enjoy your Super Bowl Sunday? -I did. I mean, how many commercials was Tom Brady in? -It's unbelievable. -Do you think one brand would be like, \"Maybe someone else has thought of using Tom Brady\"? -Yes. -It was -- But it was amazing. -Same people were in everything. But I thought you'd be excited about it because I know you played a little football. -I did. Well, you know, I -- Barely. -Look at that stud. Come on. What, are you kidding me? [ Cheers and applause ] Great photo. -This is my brother. We both played. I mean, I played for like -- I mean, some of it is I played Division III for a year. And, you know, because of the Internet, it looks like I was a total jock, but I really -- -That counts. That helped me -- -Just the fact that you got dressed up makes it count, Jim. -It does count, right? -It totally counts. -I look like -- You know, look at me. I had hair. It was nice. -No. And also, I want to congratulate you on \"Saturday Night Live,\" by the way. You were unbelievable as Tim Walz. [ Cheers and applause ] -Thank you. -Here you are as Tim Walz. Maya Rudolph was Kamala Harris. -That was -- Thank you. [ Cheers and applause ] -What was it like? I didn't want to bother you while you were doing it, but were you excited? Were you -- -Oh, my gosh, it was so amazing. It's like you're invited to, like, graduate school at Harvard, you know? -Yeah. -Participating on \"SNL.\" And then they pull in all these MVPs. And so I was just -- I was kind of blown away. But it was amazing. And it was so fun to play Governor Walz, because, I mean, I grew up in the Midwest, so I just did an impression of my brother Mitch, so... [ Laughter ] -Perfect. -Who's a sweet guy who is sentimental and a sincere guy. So I just did that. And when I went in for makeup, they were like, \"You're good,\" you know? -Wow. -It was perfect. -That never happens. Yeah. The last time we hung out together, hopefully you remember this. I will never forget this. We met the Pope. -Yes. The Pope. Unbelievable. The Pope invited comedians... -To the Vatican. -...to the Vatican. Throughout the world -- I don't, you know. -This is real. -That shows you where the Catholic Church is at right now. -Here's you shaking hands. -No, it was amazing. And it was -- [ Laughter and applause ] -This is me. -It was -- [ Cheers and applause ] It was -- -We met the Pope. -What you have to understand is there was this room filled with comedians throughout the world. It's almost like all the people that couldn't behave in church or synagogue... [ Laughter ] ...or a mosque had to see the principal. -Yes. -And it was so amazing. It was like 6:00 in the morning. And the Pope did say, you know, that humor is really important, which was beautiful. And I think -- I don't know about you, but like, I'm kind of like, \"Yeah, that's really nice to hear, but I just do it because I like attention, you know?\" -Yeah, yeah. [ Laughter ] -But it was pretty special, right? And as a Catholic kid -- You grew up Catholic, right? -Yeah. Of course. -It's a huge thing. And you do feel like, as a Catholic or even a lapsed Catholic, you're jumping the line because there are such sincere Catholics that know what's going on. Like, to this day, I'm in church and I've been going for, I don't know, 58 years. And I'm like, \"Oh, now we stand up?\" [ Laughter ] I still don't know. -I still don't know the rules. I don't know the rules. I guess we're all kneeling. I guess we're kneeling. -Alright, we're doing this now? -We're doing this. Yeah. -You know, so, but it's amazing. -It was always great. It was great to see you. And I kept looking over at you, and I'm like, \"Is this real?\" -Yeah. No, there's something wrong. -Yes. There's something wrong. It was great. And how's the family doing? -Good. Good. Good. You know, I'm still recovering from Christmas break. You know, I travel with -- My wife and I, we travel with our kids, and it's -- It's always kind of a disaster. You know what I mean? -Yeah. -I don't know what the thinking is. It's kind of like, \"Hey, you know, we bicker and argue. Why don't we take this on the road?\" You know? [ Laughter ] How would you like to not listen to me in a hotel room? You know? [ Laughter ] Maybe you should spend too much time on your phone in a different state. -Yeah. -But my kids love it. They have a blast. They're on vacation. I'm not sure what they're on vacation from. Uh, can you really be on vacation from eighth grade? I don't know, you know. It's like my son goes from barely doing homework to doing absolutely nothing. -Yeah, it's a vacation. Yeah, but you're busy, man. You're on tour now. You're going back out. You have a solo tour, but also you're going back out with Jerry Seinfeld. -Jerry Seinfeld. I'm trying to help Jerry. -Jerry. He needs -- [ Cheers and applause ] -Poor guy. -He needs ticket sales. -It is so fun touring with Jerry because obviously he is kind of like a comedy Aristotle. And by the way, you had Letterman here, which is -- it's just these legends. It's unbelievable. -Yeah. -And Jerry is, uh... [ Applause ] Jerry's somebody -- you know, it's fun touring because everyone has their own rituals. And Jerry, every morning on tour you have breakfast and then you go see a movie, and then you go to lunch, and then you go for a walk. And that's more than I do in like a week. -Yeah. A lot of work. [ Laughter ] -He does all this stuff and it's so fascinating just hanging out, and you know, as a comedian, just like when you go on do shows with Nate, some of it is fun doing the shows, but it's fun hanging out with other comedians. -And just talking. -Yeah. -Yeah, and just -- Yeah, go and see the movie too. I remember going to see the daytime movies because comedians have nothing to do during the day. -Yes. And you -- when you're coming up and, you know, you're just a bunch of losers. You just hang around each other. -Yeah. -And so when you get some success, they bring you, you know. Your success brings you away from your friends. So it's always so special when you can hang out. -And your tour, your solo tour, Everything Is Wonderful. -Yes. -Is the name of the tour. Are you excited to go back out? -I'm so excited. I'm doing some shows in Kentucky and Tennessee for the sole purpose of acquiring bourbon in Tennessee. -Yes. [ Cheers and applause ] By the way, your bourbon is unbelievable. -Oh, thank you so much. -You brought some last time you were on the show. It's not a joke. It's not like just some celebrity name, Jim Gaffigan's Father Time? What is it? -Father Time. Yeah. -Father Time. It's fantastic, buddy! -Oh, thank you. -Thank you very much. -I've gotten so into bourbon, and bourbon is a uniquely American spirit. It really -- I mean, and when I say spirit, I don't mean, like, rah-rah spirit or whoo spirit, I mean glug-glug spirit. -Okay. Yeah, yeah, of course. [ Laughter ] -But after you glug-glug, you might be rah-rah or whoo! So it all kind of works together. -Yeah. -But I, you know, it's so fun doing these shows. And since I've gotten into it, you know, Kentucky and Tennessee and North Carolina, Texas, it's just -- there's amazing distilleries out there and people have to go and buy your local bourbon. You got to check it out. There's some great stuff out there. -Support the bourbons out there. Yeah. Why not? Let's talk about your very funny special. It's called \"The Skinny.\" In part, it's because you talk in the special how you lost a lot of weight. -Well, you know, I mean, I think it's such an interesting thing to say I lost it because I, you know, I'm on an appetite suppressant, so I didn't have anything to do with it. [ Laughter ] I shouldn't get any credit. It's a little bit like when, like, we compliment supermodels for being beautiful. It's like they were just born that way, right? And so I love the fact that I've lost weight, but it's, you know, essentially, this drug has made me eat like a human, you know, whereas before I would eat like a dog. You know? [ Laughter ] -Really? -You know, like, if you give a dog -- if you leave the dog food out, the dog will eat the entire bag of food. And that's like me, you know? -Yeah, well, it's doing a great job, but I want to show a clip of your stand-up. It's very good. Here's Jim Gaffigan in \"The Skinny.\" Take a look at this. -Parenting teenagers has made me a better comedian. No, that's not it. [ Laughter ] A bitter comedian. [ Laughter ] I know that sounds negative, but it is almost sad when a kid becomes a teenager, right? Because you have this cute 12-year-old and then boom, they become Satan. [ Laughter ] You can literally witness the curiosity and wonder transform into body odor and poor judgment. [ Laughter ] And then you, the parent, you're supposed to learn how to communicate with them! My wife e-mails me articles \"how to talk to your teenager.\" I'm like, \"Delete.\" [ Laughter and applause ] -Jim Gaffigan, everybody. \"The Skinny\" is streaming now on Hulu.

Buddy, \"Everything I Thought It --\" -I'm exhausted. -\"Everything I Thought It Was\" is here. -It's here. -March 15th. This is -- -It's here in a minute. -Yeah, in a minute. No, it's here, but in a minute. But \"Selfish\" came out today. -It did. -Congratulations. [ Cheers and applause ] It's finally out. -It's out. -How long have you been working on this? -Uh...four years. -Yeah. -Yeah, four years. -I've never seen anyone work harder on anything in my life than you on this album. -The only thing I work harder on is our relationship. -We have to make it work. Thank you. I appreciate you saying that, yeah. It's not hard for me at all, by the way, yeah. -Jimmy, family, career. -But, dude, it's been four years. Every time we talk, every time we hang out, and you go, \"Oh, dude, check this one out. I think you'll like this one.\" And I go, \"Okay.\" Then you're like, \"I'm changing this.\" There's no one I can think of that writes their own music, performs their own thing. You'll hum something and you're like, \"No.\" And then you'll go over to the keyboard and start playing it. Then you'll play the bass guitar. Then you start harmonizing with yourself. And then I'm like -- then you get out -- Then you pick a director for your single. -It's not at the same time. -No, it isn't. Then you dance. No one else dances. There's no one like you. You're one in a zillion, buddy. Just want to say that. [ Cheers and applause ] And this album -- get ready for this thing. I love it so much. This thing is a masterpiece. Tell me about \"Everything I Thought It Was,\" the title. When did you think of that title? And it was when we vacationed together? [ Laughter ] -It was... [ Laughter ] -It was everything you thought it was. -You and I were sitting on the beach. -Yes, that's right. -And you reached your hand over. -Yeah, we were looking at the -- We were in a bathtub. We were in two separate bathtubs. -Yeah, two separate bathtubs, and I went to grab soap at the same time. -Yes, we -- Yeah. And we just -- And we touched, and I go... And then sparks, and I go, \"That's where you got the title.\" -Everything I thought it was. -Yeah. -You can't see it. If you zoom out, I'm over here. -Yeah. -I'm right here. -No, you're -- -Where am I? -You're -- -Oh, I'm in that? Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. You put me up in a hotel room there. It's just blurry. What is \"Everything I Thought It Was\"? -You know, so -- Yeah, so, four years, that pandemic happened. -Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy. -But making this record -- this album -- was -- is different from any other one. And it's so -- You know what's so funny is you interviewing me. -Is it weird? -Because I feel like we've already had this conversation, but we have to have it so you guys can hear the story. I'm sorry. -Is it odd? Is it odd that -- Yeah. It's because people are listening. But, yeah, we have had this conversation, but -- -No, so, but I'll tell it. -Thank you. -Okay. -And we want to know. -Yeah, so, four years and different from making albums before, because I would just go in for a block of time and say, \"This is what we made, and this is what it is.\" And during the pandemic, you know, having our second son, which was unbelievable -- -Oh, shout-out to -- -Thank you. -Shout-out to Phin. We love you, bud. And -- -He's so cute. -Oh, he's so cute. They're both so cute. -They're both so cute. You lucked out. Yeah, you got a good kid. -They run our house. It's crazy. -Yeah. -But I was going back and forth, you know, two weeks writing, coming back for a month, and just doing what we call writer camps, where I would work with different songwriters, work with different producers, people that I've worked with before, people that I've never worked with before. -But how many songs did you write? Because -- -We ended up with like almost 100 songs. -Seriously. I remember -- I've heard probably -- -That's not an exaggeration. I'm not saying that because it's a nice number to say on television. We ended up with almost 100 songs. -But you cut it down. -Narrowed it down to 18 songs. -Wow. See, if I ever wrote 100 songs, I would release all 100 songs. I'd be so proud I did 100 songs. I go, \"That's it, man. That's every song I wrote in four years. There you go. Take it.\" But this is perfectly done. Everything you've done, the layers upon layers, the different tempos, it's fun, it's dancy, it's ballad. There's surprises on there. It's good. It's a \"whop, whop, whop, whop, whop.\" There's that in there. There's all sorts of fun stuff. I couldn't have said it better myself. -There you go. -It's \"whop, whop, whop, whop.\" -Dude, I mean, we played -- When did we hear the final? Was that Electric Lady? -That was at Electric Lady, yes. -And we stayed up -- Dude, I mean -- -Hold on, though. You guys -- You should have at least if not a segment on this show, another show that's called like, \"Jimmy Fallon Listens to Your Album.\" Because what happens to this man when he listens to music -- I mean, you know what happens to him. But I got the biggest kick out of just watching you listen to the album. -What was I doing? -A lot. [ Laughter ] -That was cool, man. It was just me and you in the studio chillin' out. -Yeah. Do you want me to do a re-enactment or... [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ \"What is this song?!\" Oh! What?! What!\" -\"Ahh! Who is that?!\" -\"Oh, my God!\" -I did not. That's not my dance at all. It is phenomenal. -That's just a taste. That was way worth it. [ Cheers and applause ] -I just think it's -- I'm so happy it's almost out. And, I mean -- -Me too. I'm really excited about this album. -You were saying, too, when we were listening to you, you're like, \"Dude, you know what I can't wait? I go, \"For it to come out.\" And you go, \"I can't wait to perform it.\" -Yeah. -And you were like, \"I can't wait to perform this.\" And I go, \"That is so cool.\" I got chills when you said that. I'm like -- Because I could just see you. Like, you couldn't even really sit still in your chair. You're, like, doing stuff. -Oh, I was doing that? -Oh, yeah. You were like, \"Yo, come on, man! Come on!\" What's up?! Oh, my God! You're the best, man! It's the best!\" No, but you did say you couldn't wait to perform it. Then you got to perform this -- -Did I get you in your feelings by doing that impersonation? -No. No. Do you think you did? -I don't know. I just felt like you had to retort. It was like... -Yeah, I've never really retorted, yeah. -See? James agrees. -I've never really retorted. Hey, I'm sorry about that. I blew up a little bit. I got out of control. -Sorry, buddy. -I'm sorry, buddy. I'm really sorry I got a little out of control. -I ate something spicy earlier and I had to retort. -Yeah, it's burrito season, and don't I know it. -It's burrito season. -You performed at Memphis. You crushed it. It was a free show? -I did. My hometown, yes. -Your hometown. [ Cheers and applause ] That's where you kicked it off. That's where you played \"Selfish\" for the first time. And then you are playing a free gig here at Irving Plaza in New York City. [ Cheers and applause ] -Should we tell them? Should we tell -- -Do you have something that -- -Jimmy's gonna open up. -That's not -- That's not -- No, that's not what they want to hear. -That's not what you said backstage. -That's not what you want to hear. No, what -- Are you going to perform more? [ Cheers and applause ] -Um...maybe. -Do you have something to announce? -No. No, no. I don't have anything to announce. So -- We're announcing it. -No, no, no, no. How about a little something extra? -Well, we are still putting the set list together for Irving Plaza, so... -That's not -- -That's all I got. I'm just telling you the truth. Don't \"aah\" me. [ Laughter ] -I'm just saying there could be something that the audience might want to hear if you said the right thing, that people are watching at home, they could go to justintimberlake.com, and get something if they wanted something. Is there something that you'd like to announce? [ Drum roll ] -What is happening right now? Oh, that. -Yes. -Oh, yeah. I'm going on tour. [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ -Come on! This is a world tour!

'Cause even the other team was rooting for me. That's how bad I am. That's how bad I am. The other team was going, \"Yes, Jimmy! You did something!\" -Do we -- Does that video keep going? Because Travis Kelce almost -- I saw my life flash before my eyes. He went up and did one of those, you know, when they jump. And I was like, \"He's doing it. I have to do it.\" And I forgot that he weighs like 80 pounds more than me. -Yeah. And basically I tackled -- -Do we still have that? -Do we have extra? -We do? -Show this. -He -- Wait. -Here comes you. -Yeah! -Ohh! [ Laughter ] Now... Now...

And he's like, \"Do you want me to say the obvious?\" -Right. -\"Justin Timberlake.\" It was really funny. And it's -- Do you guys -- Do you talk all the time? -We text. I don't want to bother him. He's busy right now. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -He's in the zone. -You're the musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" this Saturday night. -I am.

And, you know, \"SNL\" is such a special thing for me. I watched when I was a kid. That was obviously Saturday night. So, um, that was the night I got to stay up late and watch \"SNL.\" And I was like, \"God, I want to be on that show so bad. They look like they're having more fun than anyone else in the world.\" This is before I met you. And, uh... -Yeah. And Dakota Johnson is hosting. -Dakota Johnson is hosting. -She's the host.

I'm so -- I can't even. This is crazy. -Alright, good, good. I'm excited. I have things I want to ask about you. One is your name -- Rachel. -Yes. -You got this -- You got your name from someone very famous. And am I right? -You are correct. I was named after Rachel Green from \"Friends.\" -Okay, good. Alright. That is real? -That is real. That is a real fact. And everybody -- Nobody ever believes me because they think that there's no way I'm young enough to be named after \"Friends.\" But -- -No, you were. -But I am, yeah. My mom -- They were going to name me Catherine, but my older sister's Jacqueline, and they thought that might be too confusing for babies to figure out. -Yeah. Catherine and Jacqueline. Yeah. -Yeah. And, so, yeah, my mom loved the way it sounded on \"Friends\" for Jennifer Aniston, and then that was my name. -I mean, that's a perfect person to be named -- We love -- Who doesn't love Jennifer Aniston or Rachel? -I love Jennifer. -You could have been named after the hairstyle. -I could have been Ross. -You could have been Ross. -Who knows? -You could have been Ross. Yeah, alright. -All right, why not, right? -Ross Zegler's got a good name to it, as well. -Yeah, right? -Well, if you want to have a brother... I want to talk to you about this, because I know you're a big -- You're a big Swiftie. -Yes. -And you were at the... [ Cheers and applause ] I mean, how cool are you? -She looks very sad, but that was just because I had food poisoning. -No. -I did. -You did not. -I did. You still went to the show. -Oh, I would not have -- I sold my kidney to be there. -Really? -Yeah. -You love her that much? -I love her so much. -Back-in-the-day Swiftie? -Yeah. From self-titled album, which we're still waiting for the re-record of. [ Cheers and applause ] See? I found my people in the audience. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. But do you -- Are you one of those people at the concerts that yell out, \"Oh, the next song is going to be this or...\" -Oh, I knew the set list, I know the callbacks, and I was waiting for the secret songs. -Secret songs. -Yeah. -My best friend, Brenna, had gone in Atlanta, before the MetLife show, and I went to MetLife Night 1. And she said -- -Whoo! -Thank you. And she said to my older sister, Jacqueline, who I took to the show with me -- She was like, \"Jacqueline, if they play 'Getaway Car' or 'Maroon,' she's on crisis watch.\" Not only did she play \"Getaway Car,\" she also played \"Maroon.\" I was having a mental breakdown in the audience at MetLife Stadium. -I love it. -Yeah. And then Ice Spice came out. And I kept making the joke -- -That's right. -Exactly. -I remember that. -Yeah. -That was a big deal. -I was making a joke all night to the girls behind me. Wherever they are, they can attest to it. I kept making the joke that Ice Spice was going to come out, not knowing anything about that actually happening, and then it happened. -Wow. So you should play the lottery that night. -Yeah. -Anything you did came true. -My Swiftie manifestation says \"Reputation TV\" is coming. [ Cheers and applause ] -Okay. -Thank you. -Right now, let's talk about \"Hunger Games,\" okay? \"The Ballad of Songbirds --\" Let's focus. The \"Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\" -Yes. -By the way, your character, Lucy Gray, sings a lot in the film. -Yes, she does. -Which is great. Which you did live on set. -I did, yeah. -You can do it. You know how to do it. I mean, I was reading somewhere, there was, like, inspirations of Dolly Parton in there. -Yeah, yeah. Well, it's -- She's a very -- She's a country, folksy singer. And, so, Suzanne Collins, who wrote the book -- she used to be a country-music deejay. So she had this, like -- -Oh! -Yeah. And it's like she has such a deep knowledge of that whole world, which I really didn't know too much about. -I didn't know she was a country deejay. -I didn't either. -That's fascinating. -Yeah. And so she's obsessed with Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, and then we kind of based her voice off of that. -How cool. -Yeah. -Well, the soundtrack -- it comes out this Friday, as well, with you are featured on it. -Yeah. -And Olivia Rodrigo is featured on the album. -Yeah. So everyone's talking about this. -Yeah. -It's already got over a million streams already. It's just crushing. Congratulations. -Thank you. -And you accidentally started a rumor, and I thought tonight would be the perfect night for you to clear up this rumor. -It's time to address it. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I accidentally started a rumor that Nicki Minaj was on the album for \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\" -That is not true. -It's not true. She's not. She's releasing her album on Friday, I believe. But it was one of those things where there's a character named Barb Azure in the movie. And the actress who plays Barb Azure has a great sense of humor. Her name is Honor Gillies. She's so fantastic. And posted a video of Nicki Minaj saying, \"Calling all Barbs\" when she got cast. And her character plays the stand-up bass in the movie. So, obviously, I commented, \"Slapping that super bass,\" as you would. -Yeah. -Now, the Barbs got me good. They were screen-shotting those comments, posting them all over social media, being like, \"What is mother doing? They are very, very, very dedicated and amazing. I am a Barb. I love Nicki. -Yeah. -But she's not on the album. But she started playing into it. She posted a TikTok with \"The Hanging Tree\" song, saying like, \"I have something coming out November 17th.\" Like, she knew what she was doing. I had no idea what I was doing. -No idea what she was doing. No, no. You were just being you and you go, \"I didn't know. I'd even start this rumor.\" -And I didn't know if she was on the soundtrack, so I was just kind of like, \"Okay.\" -And she's not. -And she's not. -Okay, good. I'm glad you said it. -Just me. -Yeah. No, good. I'm glad. It's you and Olivia Rodrigo. -Yeah. -We're happy. -Yeah. -Okay, yeah, we're good. -Thanks. -Do we set -- How do we set up the movie \"Hunger Games\"? This is pre-Katniss. -Set 64 years in the past. It's been 10 years since the districts and The Capitol have, like, gone to war. And the Hunger Games have been going on for 10 years. -It's a giant, giant, giant movie. And I would suggest go see it in IMAX because it's just a lot. -And we did film it for IMAX. It's the craziest experience. -Enjoy it. I want to show everyone a clip. Here's Rachel Zegler in \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\" Take a look. -♪ This world, it's dark ♪ ♪ This world, it's scary ♪ ♪ I've taken some, and so no wonder I'm weary ♪ ♪ It's why ♪ ♪ I need you ♪ ♪ You're as pure as the driven snow ♪ [ Vocalizing ] ♪♪ -Whoo!

Well, how old are you when you first started? -I was 15. -15. -On the show last time, I was 15. -Good for you, buddy. That's so tough. I mean, you stayed strong. I mean, that must be a lot of pressure, you know, to start a business and keep going and and keep thinking of new ideas. And then you have the show, and now your whole family is involved now. Do you ever go back and watch your old TikToks? -I do and I make fun of myself a lot because it is so embarrassing. But it's also fun to go down memory lane and be like, \"Oh, my goodness, this outfit was atrocious, but, look, it was so cute. I was a baby.\" -Yeah, yeah. You still are. You still are. I wanted to ask you something, because I saw \"Vanity Fair.\" They did a thing. You did a lie-detector test. You know what I'm about to say? -Mm-hmm. -Yeah, you love Dunkin' Donuts. -I do. -Okay, well, let's just watch this lie-detector test. -Do you actually like Dunkin' as much as you say you do? -Yes, and I shamelessly promote them so much. No, I'm such a fan of Dunkin' Donuts. -I'm happy that they're doing, like, cool stuff, though. -Do you think you like Dunkin' more than this person? -Yes. -Do you know who that is? -No. [ Laughter ] [ Cheers and applause ] -You don't know who Ben Affleck is? -No, I do, and I've, like, fully had conversations with him before. And, like, I know who -- That's why it's so unb-- My sister clowned me for that so hard the entire ride back. I was so embarrassed. -But that's hilarious. So like, \"Yeah, I love --\" \"You like it better than this person?\" And you just blanked? -Because I just, like -- I know how much -- I've had two coffees already today, you know? Like, I -- -Yes. You were in the zone of Dunkin' Donuts. -I know how much I love it, and it's more than... -Anyone. -...anyone. -Yeah, including that person who, at the time, you didn't know. -Now I've looked at the photos, I feel like we can be equal. -Oh, my God. That's so funny. You were telling me backstage, though, that you actually had a great meeting with Jennifer Lopez... -Yeah. -...who is like -- Gosh, we have that in common. She is unbelievable. We both love Jennifer Lopez. -I love her. She was the absolute sweetest. Every single time I've spoken to her, she, like, can see inside my brain and tell me exactly what I need to hear without even knowing. Like, genuinely, my dream when I was younger was to be a backup dancer for her. That was all that I ever wanted in life. -Me too. -I'm such a fan. We still can. -We still can, yeah. Jennifer, if you're watching, we're in. Yeah. -If you need us. -She is just the best, right? She is a pro. When she comes on the show, I mean, she -- Her in concert. Go -- If she tours again -- Well, she will. -But -- -She's insane. -A professional. She puts the work in, man. -It's incredible. -Yeah. I know Halloween is coming up, and you're a big fan of Halloween. Can you say what you're dressing up as? No? -I have, like, a list, quite a long list, in my notes of -- I work on it all year long, add to it every week, you know? But, so far, I only have like one or two locked down. I want to do Boo from \"Monsters, Inc.\", because I have the bob, and I feel like it just kind of works, you know? -Okay. That's good. -But, I mean, my boyfriend and I were trying to do, like, cute couples costumes, but we're so indecisive that we just, like, can't actually get it together. -Yeah. -We have time. -You do have a little time. Yeah. Yeah. You have like a -- Yeah, you have like a week. You don't really have time, to really be honest. Your career has actually blown up. It's so cool to watch on TikTok. Now you turn it into a business now. You have a shoe line. Talk about this. How fun is that? -It's crazy. I mean, all I really know about shoes is the fact that I wear them every day, so I don't know how it actually works, but we have such an amazing team behind us that can, you know -- We're in heels a lot. There's three girls in the family. We're all constantly, like, blisters, everything hurts. So it's been really fun to take my favorite parts of shoes and my least favorite parts of shoes and work it all together and make them comfortable, stylish, cute, get to pick the colors, the shapes, the silhouettes, the styles. So it's really fun. -I mean, you have everything. You have, like -- You have slides. You have sneakers. I'm like, it's so -- Actually, you wore them in today. I was like, \"You should just wear them out with your dress. Why not?\" They're, like -- They're cute sneakers. But that's wild that you go, \"Yeah, I had this idea and I'm going to make it real.\" And you're making all this stuff a reality. -I know. It's insane. -I'm so happy for you, buddy. -Thank you! -Really. I'm a big... [ Cheers and applause ] And the show, \"The D'Amelio Show,\" is streaming on Hulu. -Yes. -How is the family holding up? How's the parents? Are they going -- Yeah, is it going to their head, the fame? -You know, the fam is good. We are together a lot. It's great. I mean, I live with my older sister and we work together, so we spend quite a lot of time together. You know, sisters -- we argue, but we love each other. -A lot of family bonding. -Yeah. A lot. -Yeah. We love it every time you come by. Thank you so much, and congrats on the show and on the shoes, as well. -Thank you! -Charli D'Amelio, everybody.

Yeah, I'm going to sit. -First of all, by the way, look at this vinyl. -I love it. Yeah. This is one of the colors. We have so many different colors. I'm obsessed with vinyl. It's beautiful. -I have too much. But yeah, I didn't like several different colors. -You have vinyl when I did your show when it was in Los Angeles. -Yes. -And you had a record player in your dressing room. -Yes, I have them everywhere. -Do you still have it with you? -Yes, I have them everywhere. -You're our neighbor now. You're right across the hall. I know, rough commute today. -Yeah. Welcome. -Yeah. I love it. But I forgot, I was telling you backstage. Like I forget, like, when my show ends and I'm going home, like, your show is beginning. And so I'm running into people in the hallway and I'm like, \"This is -- I'm not this cool, but I feel cool.\" [ Chuckles ] -Because, you know, everybody. You're like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" -I know, you run into people, and I'm like, \"Oh, that's awesome.\" -Did you have a great first -- first week here? -I did, we -- Well, I will say my very first day, um... [ Chuckles ] I -- Look, I was very tired, and we were working a lot, and I had -- I had gotten a venti matcha iced tea latte and then I was just tired. I don't know what happened, but I got on, it was F4, the elevator, F4. -That was classic. -And I -- Yeah. It is a -- It is a -- It is one of the most iconic elevators ever isn't it? -Fallon 4. -That's so funny. -Yeah. -Um... And then I proceeded to not only drop my drink in the entire -- Like, I mean a full venti. And then it looked like art. It looked like it went. It went, like, all over. -Oh, my gosh. -And then I knew there were cameras. So I was like, I was like, \"Oh, my God, this is going to be seen my first time here.\" Anyway, I have completely trashed an elevator. That was my first -- you -- you now have a rock star in the building, so. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. You trashed. -By the way... -Trashed the elevator on my way in. -You really did. Look at this. Oh, my gosh. -Yeah, no. And you... -You really did. -You're not even... -I've never seen that. -You're not even getting the full spectrum. It went to the ceiling. -Did you throw it? Did you slam it down? -No! I was standing there and it just slipped out of my hands. And I was like, \"What the...?\" And it went -- It went everywhere. -Oh, my gosh. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -That's a great way to.. -You're welcome \"30 Rock.\" Thank you for having me. -[ Chuckles ] -I'm sure I'll be -- I'll be asking you for favors like \"Kelly. Please come over whenever.\" -Oh, my gosh. You know I love games. -Come sing a song. -Yeah I will sing. I will do anything. -Yeah. -Tap dance. Whatever. -Is there a song, by the way, that you've sang more than any other song besides your own songs? -Um, probably Aretha maybe. I don't know. I've sang a lot -- A lot of songs. But probably \"Never Loved a Man\" by Aretha Franklin. -Oh, really? Was that the song you would sing, like, when you were a kid like trying out and going to talent shows? -Oh, no. Like my very first -- I did do stuff from Aretha, but my very first song, I ever, which was a bold song to pick. I would love to say I was brave and bold. I was just stupid. But I picked \"Vision of Love.\" [ Chuckles ] -Oh, my gosh. -Yeah. -Mariah Carey. -I was feeling very good about it and it went well. It went fine. But like, I just -- Why would you pick that song as your first song to sing in front of people? I don't know. -Because you like, maybe you like the pressure. -I just love the song. -Did you ever tell Mariah that that was your song? -No. Oh, my God. So what -- [ Chuckles ] I did, I did talk to her because I was like, \"Oh, I\" -- She knows I adore her. Because I've run into her several times and she's probably got me on some security list to, like, keep me away, but... -Are you in The Lamb-- Are you a lamb? Are you in The Lambily? -I'm a lamb. I love her. I love her, yes. But I -- [ Inhales sharply ] I did something stupid. She came on \"The Voice.\" And we were working together, and I just -- Sometimes I say everything that's in my brain, and I shouldn't do that. But I was trying to say because she was like, \"Oh, yeah, like you're writing, too.\" I was like, \"Oh, my God, I know all your songs.\" Like, I'm a huge fan of her. People don't realize she wrote all of that. Like not just sang it, like, she wrote everything. And she was like, \"Well, we should write together.\" And then in my head, I was just like, \"Oh, yeah, I don't really write like. I can't be, like, that vulnerable, like, in a room. I usually just like, write on my own.\" And then I walked away and my, my friends were like, \"Do you, do you realize you just told Mariah Carey no?\" [ Laughter ] -Mariah Carey wants to write a song with you, and you were like, \"That's not what it meant.\" -That's not what I meant. I meant I'm not the best. Writing for me does not come out in that scenario. I'm usually alone. Anytime you see my name on a song, I wrote it. Usually alone. Yeah,but you would love to write a song with Mariah Carey? -I would love to write. I love you, Mariah Carey, and I will -- I will risk it for you. -Yeah. Yeah. But I just also saw you recently. You made some headlines because you rewrote the lyrics to... -Oh, \"Piece by Piece.\" -\"Piece by Piece.\" Yeah. I didn't realize. it was going to -- Yeah, I just -- Look, I was finding a hard time singing it, like I was like, I don't know if I want to really sing that, you know? And I'm at a different place. And I was a very different place, and I. -Is it hard for you for have that happen in your personal life when you have the talk show? -Yeah. -You're the most open and talking every day and you're like, \"Well, now I really actually have to talk about this because, -Yeah, I know. -...my private life. -No, totally. And I'm going to be real with you. Like, I -- Those were the last two seasons specifically were very hard like behind the scenes. I don't know if you've ever done this. I'm sure you have, because you've done this for so long. But, you know, sometimes you send your representative because it's like, I can't show up today. Like I just have to, like, go through the motions and be a robot because I, if I didn't, I would break down. So this is -- I'm excited about season five here in New York because it's so -- it's -- I'm in such a great place. My little kids are in such a great place. I'm happy, I'm present in interviews I'm on. -Yes. [ Cheers and applause ] It's like, yeah. Because I wasn't. -I love you, buddy. I'm here for you if you need anything. -Thank you. -But I was thinking about you. By the way, congrats on the great reviews and success on \"Chemistry.\" -Thank you. I saw that you redid those lyrics and I go, Oh, my gosh, that must have been...\" -But now everybody wants me to record that one. [ Laughing ] So, I'm, like... -That version. -The new version of \"Piece by Piece.\" It's like the most requested. -When I read it, somebody wants to do, it's called the healing version. -Yeah, it's like a -- But you know what? It is very true. Because, you know, now that I rewrote it literally an hour before I went on stage in Vegas to like, sing it because I was like, I can't sing these lyrics, but I know people want me to sing the song. And so I changed it right before the show, and, you know, it kind of put perspective on me as well. It's like that was a lot of pressure to put on someone, you know, to pick up the pieces of something of your past. So it's kind of -- It was a lot of -- There was a lot going on for me that day, but it ended up working out. -Do you get emotional when you...? -Do I get emotional anywhere all the time? [ Laughter ] Like, right now? -Hello, this is my venti. Hello! -Welcome to 30 rock! -I did not want a venti. I wanted a large. This is too much! Now no one drinks it. -I just, I don't know what happened. It slipped. It slipped. I don't know what happened. -Wow. -It was art. -I mean, you're doing this. I go like, ooph. I think I would get, like, all kind of like, I don't know if I'd make it through the song. -I don't know, you just do. -You just do. -Yeah, you just do. But yeah, the audience was really -- My audience is cool. And they were like, cheering me on because they noticed, obviously, I started changing them. They're very intimate shows. And so these are like fans that have been with me for the ride and they notice and then they're all like screaming, like I'm like, \"Rudy,\" you know, at the end of the movie, like making it. You made it! -Carrying on their shoulders, like, \"Yeah, Kelly!\" -She's making it. -She did it. -It's -- \"Chemistry\" is the name of the album. I love the title. Did you always know that was going to be your title? -You know, at once I wrote that song. I kind of envisioned it as the title for it, just because it's definitely a roller coaster. It's not just a divorce album, it's a relationship album. There's the good and the the bad and the hard. All of it is in there. So chemistry can be good and bad. -Yeah. -As I've personally found out as well. So yeah, I kind of knew that. -I love you have a couple of guest stars on this album. -Can you believe it? Sheila E. is playing on -- That's right. -Sheila E. is my... -I love her. -She's been here and she can play. -And she's also such a quality human. Like she's so nice. I love her so much. And then I asked Steve Martin because I knew he played banjo and I referenced the movie \"It's Complicated,\" which is one of my favorite movies, and I've seen it a billion times, and I love him so much. And I asked if he would play on it, and I totally thought he was going to say no, and he didn't. Yeah. So he's on my record. -Wait a minute. That's your -- -That's your -- That's your guest stars Sheila E. and Steve Martin. -Who am I? -Yeah I was like, \"I have made it.\" -Yeah I'm happy that the new season \"Kelly Clarkson Show\" is back, It's on Monday. And I thank you for being here. And you're going to perform for us tonight I think it's actually... But before you're doing a special performance tomorrow night. -Yes, I am, I'm actually. This is awesome. I'm performing -- performing -- Audacy's put together this We Can Survive concert. And a bunch of artists are coming together for such a great cause, and actually, I have a ticket for everybody in the audience to come. [ Cheers and applause ] -I mean it's \"One Republic,\" \"Maroon 5.\" You guys all get tickets. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Giant concert, Audacy, We Can Survive concert. -Yes! -Kelly Clarkson, everybody.

This one is cut, this one stays.\" And I would sort of be in charge of the assemblies. -You would do skits for people? -We would do skits for people in front of the school. And by the end of the week, it would always be the same thing, which was just a skit starring me that I'd ripped off from \"SNL\" the week before. [ Laughter ] -Word for word? -Yeah. Yes. Like, with giving \"SNL\" no credit. -No, no, no. Yeah. -Just being like, \"Come on, guys. I came up with something last night. Let's just go for it. It's called a cheerleader sketch.

What was this? What was this? -This is -- Okay. [ Laughs ] I was 20 years old in that picture. I guess it was the year 2000. I just moved to L.A. I knew I wanted to be an actor. I had no idea what to do to become an actor. I had a car and that was it. -That's a big deal. Even having a car is a big deal. -Yeah. And I'd ask around and my friend said, \"What you need is something called a headshot. And that's a picture of your head.\" [ Laughter ] \"And then you send it out to people. They're like, 'Hey, that's a good head. I'll look and meet him.' You know?\" -Yeah, I'll put that head in my movie. Yeah. -Yeah. So I knew I needed a headshot and I was in an area of L.A. called West Hollywood, which you know West Hollywood. It's a great part of Hollywood, predominantly gay area. -Yeah. -Really kind of a fabulous place. I was at the post office. There's a guy who is like looking at me for a long time and he was like, \"You look familiar. Have I shot you before?\" And I was like, \"Oh, I've never been shot.\" [ Laughter ] -Yeah, yeah. -\"Have you shot somebody?\" I don't think you've ever shot me. -Either way, I'm fine. -I would know. -I would never press charges. -Yeah. -I'm fine. -He was like, \"I'm a photographer.\" In my head, I'm like, \"Do you do headshots?\" He's like, \"Yeah. My apartment is two blocks from here.\" [ Laughter ] I was like, \"Let's go, let's go.\" [ Laughter ] So I walk over to the apartment. This guy's got like a penthouse suite, really nice. He's like, \"You probably need to take a shower. You're a little messed up.\" He was right. He was right. I lived in the car. ♪♪ Hey, I'm just painting a picture here. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -So I took the shower, I got cleaned up. I did my hair, as you can see. Like, you know, picked it out a little. And then he was like, \"That shirt's not going to do. Here's one of mine.\" He gave me this shirt that's in the picture. It's a white shirt. -That's his shirt? -It's a nice shirt. I couldn't afford that shirt. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -I had that shirt. And then he takes the pictures. He tells me what to do, tilt my head, put my arm like this, takes the film out of the camera, sticks it in the thing. He hands me three rolls of camera film, which at the time would have cost me like 400, 500 bucks, you know, like head shots are not inexpensive. And he was like, \"Good luck, kid.\" And I walked out of there and then I decided that this was the best one.

And Lake Stevens, Washington, and people would go get out of their car and go into the mini mart and I would be hidden in the Viking Drive In over the intercom and I would mess with them. I'd be like, \"Hey, buddy, I need your help.\" [ Laughter ] -People looking around. \"Who's saying that?\" Yeah, yeah, exactly. -I'd be like, \"It's me. God.\" [ Laughter ] It was awesome. -Coming from a drive-through speaker like, \"This is the calling, God talking to me.\" -It was pretty great. -But it must have been good to have your own pocket money at 14. -Yeah. Yeah, it was good. Well, here's a lesson I learned because the lady who who owned the place was like, \"Listen, if you ever want to eat something, you just eat something. Just make sure you write it down. We'll give it you for half price and then we'll just take it out of your check.\" I was like, \"Cool.\" So it was kind of a credit system. -Yeah. -And I worked there -- I think I got paid every two weeks and I got my first check and they were like, \"Okay, let's just see. Here's what you got. Oh, you owe us $80.\" [ Laughter ] I was like, \"What?!

I'll take you to a cigar bar, and I'll teach you how.\" [ Normal voice ] I go -- And he's a man of his word. Called me on the phone. -No. -Said, \"Jimmy, it's Arnold. I'm going to a cigar bar.\" And I was with -- I was with Drew Barrymore and my wife, and I go, \"Do you guys want to go to a cigar bar with Arnold Schwarzenegger?\" They're like, \"Let's do it.\" We showed up, and we all smoked cigars. -Come on. -It was the best. Love that dude. Congrats, Opa. Opa? -Opa Arnold. -Congratulations, Opa. [ Cheers and applause ] -Stogies. -Congrats to you and Katherine. -Thanks, man. Thank you. Yeah, we're blessed. We feel very blessed. -Good, nice parents. I want to talk \"Super Mario Bros.\" because that is -- That's the jam. I'm excited about this Wednesday. -Let's go. [ Cheers and applause ] -I'm excited. -Go see it. -You're Mario. -I'm Mario. I'm the voice of Mario. -So what happens when you get the phone call and they're like, \"Hey, would you like to be this iconic...\" -I'm like, \"Pfft. No.\" [ Laughter ] -Yeah. Exactly. -I was like, \"Oh, my God! Really?!\" Yeah, I mean, you get that call. And it's just really exciting because, I mean, if you think about it, all the IP that's out there, anything that has reach, it's already been remade. It's already been turned into a TV show or a movie. And for some reason, the Super Mario Bros. hasn't been a movie for almost 30 years. And it's because I think the folks at Nintendo just didn't want to give anybody the permission to make the movie, and so finally they made... -Oh, Illumination is -- -Illumination, you know -- \"Despicable Me,\" \"Secret Life of Pets.\" -\"Minions.\" Brilliant. -\"Minions.\" Incredible studio. And so they partnered up and they decided that they were going to make this movie. And so when something like that comes around, it's just like -- you're so blessed, so honored to do it, I mean, for me... -It's fantastic. It's gonna crush, buddy. And, you know, I was thinking about you because I was watching it, and there's a lot of action. There's a lot of action in this movie. And I could just kind of hear you -- a lot of grunting by you. -Yes. -Going like... [ Grunting ] And I go -- I was like -- \"Oh, maybe Chris will bring footage,\" of you doing those grunts when you come on the show. I just want to see you in the sound booth going like... [ Both grunting ] -Well, you know, here's an interesting thing about that, actually. Usually the effort sounds you do at the end of the session. You probably do like one or two sessions a month over the course of a couple years to voice one of these movies. And at the end, because the efforts and the grunts and the screaming, that really takes it out of your voice, they save that for the end. But here's an interesting little tidbit. In a -- What makes physical comedy work in like a \"Tom and Jerry\" or a \"Super Mario Bros.\" is when a character falls a long way and hits, they don't die, right? If they died, it would -- If Tom and Jerry -- If, like, Road Runner -- If, like, the anvil hit his head and there's freaking brains everywhere... -No, no, no, no, no. That'd be terrible. [ Laughter ] -Be like, \"Oh, my God!\" That'd be bad, right? -Terrible idea. Terrible. -So in order to let kids know that the character's not dead... -Yes. -...you have to do an, \"I'm okay, I'm alive\" sigh. \"I'm hurt, not injured\" sigh. So it's like this. You're like, \"Aaaaaah!\" Unh! Uhh... -Yeah! [ Applause ] -Without that... [ Cheers and applause ] -It just goes, hey, it's a joke, everybody. -Kids will be like, \"Mario is dead! Mario fell to his death, Dad!\" -That's so funny. It's so well-done. It's such a great cast. Everyone's so talented and good. A lot of fun people. -Good luck. -Super Mario Bros. -Boom! Let's see the answer! [ Ding! ] Yes! Super Mario Bros.! -Wow. -Wow. That was a hard question. -How was that a hard question? -James. Oh, yo! [ Mario power-up sound plays ] -[ Laughs ] -How was that a hard question? It's basically every video game right there. -Right. It was hard. That was a difficult question. -Alright. -Now, here's your question. -Yeah. Oh, good luck. -Good luck, James. -Yeah. ♪♪ [ Laughter ] Who's the creator? -I mean, I'm a Nintendo nerd.

      "page_content": "-Welcome back, everybody. We are here with the one and only Michelle Obama. Now... [ Cheers and applause ] We're always so happy you come on the show. Thank you very much. I noticed that you went back -- you went back to the White House recently. You haven't been back. -No. Wasn't invited. [ Laughter ] Ooh, shade. [ Laughter ] -Wow. Wow. I'm adding a chapter right here. Hold on. -Oh, yeah. -And so you return. What did it feel like to go back and you go, \"Oh, yeah, I lived a lot of time in this place\"? -We were -- We were good when it was time to go. No, it was really a beautiful experience because, you know, that's a tradition. You do your official portraits. The next president is supposed to invite you back to hang them. We were never invited back. So these pictures had been done for a long, long time. But it's also a chance for the staff to come back and reminisce and to be together. It's a -- It's a ritual. So it was good to see everybody. It was good to see all of the staff. I mean, as quiet as it's kept, my girls lived in the White House longer they lived any house. -Yeah. -So that's where they grew up. So to go back and to see all the staff that are still there, to see all the people that they grew up with, it was really -- Well, the girls weren't there at the time, but it was good for Barack and I to see everyone. -Do you ever have dreams that you still live there? -Oh! No. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that like that. It's like -- No, no, I don't -- I don't have dreams. -You don't ever go like, \"Oh, yeah, I'll go down the steps here and do that.\" -No. No. Funny story. At Biden's inauguration, all the formers gathered, and they were doing a public service announcement. And then we had to leave. And this is the first time Barack attended -- I think he was there when somebody else's presidential motorcade was out. So he walks out, and usually the first car up is the President, right? And he goes walking to the first car, and his security is like, \"Sir, um, that's not -- that's not your car.\" -Oops. -He's like, \"Oh.\" He's like, \"Okay. Well, where do I go?\" So we had to pass the presidential motorcade, then the VP, and then we went way back, and then it was ours. Because you go in descending order. -You're like, \"But I was just...\" -But the thing was, we were so glad to get in that back motorcade and to go home... -Yeah. -...to our house. -To your actual house. -You know, that's the progress of democracy. You do your time, you pass it on, you let the next president lead. And so it was -- it's kind of a relief. -In this book, there's so many great stories about your life, but there's also tips on how to deal with what we're dealing with, with everything, with what we all -- isolation with COVID. And just everything is kind of touched in this book. And one thing I loved is \"the power of small.\" -Yeah, yeah, that's one of the early chapters because -- I wrote this chapter particularly for young people who are feeling so anxious about the state of the world. I mean, no wonder. Climate change, riots on Capitol Hill, gun violence, on and on. And these young kids, young kids as young as 15, are trying to figure out how to solve these problems, and they're getting all twisted because they don't yet have the power because they're trying to bite off too much, too soon. And so \"the power of small\" is to focus on what you can uniquely control. And for a kid in high school, it's graduating from high school. You know, get your education because you can't do that -- You can't end violence in your neighborhood unless you focus on what's at hand. So starting small, even for us as adults, is about focus on your own knitting because there's power in that. You know, if each of us just raise the children we bring into the world -- you know, if we did nothing else but do that -- oh, just imagine where we would be as a nation, as a human race, if we just took care of that, if we showed them the love and the focus and if we put our time and energy into that instead of trying to solve all the big problems. So change happens in small bites. It's not just the big stuff. -Yeah, because it starts small, then it goes to a family, then it goes to a community. And it was great. There's also a chapter dedicated to \"when they go low, we go high.\" -Well, people still keep asking me, \"You still mean that?\" -Yeah. But that was -- that was an epic line. That was just -- It stuck in everyone's head. Did you realize how powerful that would be years after? -No, no. I didn't know I'd be known for that line. But I'm proud of that. People ask me, do I still -- do I ever go low? And, yeah, I go low. -You do. -I go low a lot of times. But I think for people who have a platform, who are being looked up to, we have a responsibility to stay high because kids are watching us. If you need to go low, go low at home. Do it with your kitchen table, with your spouse. But we set the example, because leaders set the tone. And we felt what it felt like to be led with low, and it didn't feel great. That's why it's important. It's a practice. It's a habit. It's something we show the next generation, that we don't -- That doesn't mean we settle. That doesn't mean we're complacent. It means we think before we speak, because words matter, and I still believe that. And I try the best that I can when I'm in the public eye, when I know that kids are watching, to stay high because high begets high. -That's right. [ Cheers and applause ] Now, uh... you went on a book tour around the country, and you had amazing conversations with amazing people. Our pal Gayle King, who we love. Tyler Perry. -Lots of great people. -Hoda Kotb. -David Letterman. -David Letterman. -Oh, so many. Sure. Conan O'Brien. Sure. -Alright. Alright. You were busy. -Yeah, yeah. It's interesting. But, you know, there's always time for another book, you know? Um... But the list is -- Amazing people. And you turned it into a podcast. -Yeah. -And this is great. It's a great thing. You have to listen to it. It's such great conversation. -\"The Light Podcast.\" So, for those who missed the book tour, we've recorded every conversation, edited down to the best of the best. And, you know, it touches on the book, but we also each share our own stories of finding light and developing friendships and relationships. It's really a fun set of conversations that are now on Audible. -And then you have -- One of the interviews or the conversations are with Oprah Winfrey. -The one and only. -Yeah. Oprah Winfrey. And it airs -- -That Oprah. -That Oprah. And it's airing on April 25th on Netflix as a special. -Yeah, that will be televised because when you're with Oprah, you just televise it. -I just feel like, yeah, you have to televise it. Yeah, but you have actually become friends with Oprah Winfrey. You guys are really -- -I mean, Oprah was one of the very early supporters before Barack was even thinking about running. I mean, she spotted him when he was a U.S. senator. And she has sort of been -- Oprah is that person who never asks for anything but is always there with her generosity and love and support. There isn't anything you can't ask her to do if you're a friend that she won't try to do. She is who she appears to be. -Yeah. -And I am lucky to call her a friend. -I want to show a clip from your special. Here's a look at \"The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.\" -When you first arrived in Hawaii, you were looking for -- and I understand why -- You were a working woman and had never been to Hawaii. So you're looking for the Hawaii in \"Hawaii Five-0.\" Those of you who remember that show. -Mai Tais and sunsets on the beach. -And honeymoon suites. -Instead... -Yeah, instead, it was a trip home to visit his family. That's where he was from. He wasn't going back to some island vacation. He was going back to be with his people. But I was young and I was -- It was cold in Chicago, and I thought, \"I'm going to Hawaii with my man. It's going to be so romantic.\" [ Laughter ] And then we landed, and we went straight to Toot and Gramps' apartment. No ocean. It was a high-rise building. Go up to the 10th floor. You know, walk in. Looks like my grandparents' house. Might as well be on the South Side of Chicago. -[ Laughs ] It's not reality. I love it. Michelle Obama, everybody. \"The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey\" premieres April 25th on Netflix. More \"Tonight Show\" after the break. Stick around.

Especially to do it with the guys we did it with, the ups and downs through it, the adversity of the season. It was a lot of fun, man. -But also to do it with Patrick Mahomes. That's where I met you. You guys were together. -Oh, yeah. -Was that a plan for you guys to hang out on the off-season and be kind of best friends. -I think it just happened organically. It was just like, \"Hey, man, what are you doing? You're about to go to Vegas and play golf? Alright, let's do it.\" -Really? -And it's been awesome since he's been in Kansas City. He doesn't get enough credit for the type of leader that he is, the type of just personable guy he is in the locker room. And it's on and off the field. He does unbelievable things in the community in Kansas City. And that's the kind of, you know, vibe that I like to be around, man. -Yeah. -And it was just kind of like magnets when he got to K.C. -Yeah, but I -- 'Cause I was thinking, \"Oh, maybe this is a plan. Maybe Andy Reid said, 'Hey, you guys should be best friends. Just go play with each other.'\" -Just compete and -- -Go to a movie. Go to a movie, go do something, go watch Netflix for an afternoon or something, yeah. -It started with the, \"Hey, do you drink beers? Do you drink beer?\" -Yeah. Yeah. -Because I like to drink beers. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -It sounds like we could have some fun. -Yeah, exactly. And you guys bonded. I just thought it was great, and you have great chemistry and it's real. It's not fake at all. I witnessed it for a weekend. It was, like, so cool to watch. The parade was yesterday. -Yes. -So I want to thank you for being here today. -Oh, man, I almost didn't make it. -I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. I was actually -- I was thinking about -- I was going to call Jason if you didn't show up. I'm like, \"Dude, get over here. [ Cheers and applause ] Jason, get over here right now.\" Everyone's always asking about your brother. But that must have been just a bizarre thing to be playing in the Super Bowl with your brother. -Man, it was -- You know, you always dream growing up that you're going to one day be in the Super Bowl, especially when my brother's the reason why I even play football. Like -- Yeah, exactly. When I was growing up -- I'm two years younger than my brother. And that's about as drunk as I was at the parade right there. That's me -That's during the parade yesterday? -Yeah, that's me. That's full parade form right there. -Oh, my God. I thought this was when you were a kid. This is yesterday. -No, this is yesterday. Yeah, growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, I followed his footsteps in a lot of areas, sports being one of them and football definitely being one of them. And you always imagine, you know, playing on the same team, but, man, I'll tell you what, the way the football world and everybody embraced my family and me and my brother playing against each other -- for the first time, two brothers playing against each other in the Super Bowl. It was cool to break that barrier and see my family and all the light and getting all the glory. Man, it was beautiful. -I mean, 'cause when you were a kid, like there -- You're probably in your front yard or something? -Yeah, probably 3 or 5 years old, maybe. -Yeah, and what's the big Super Bowl there? Like, you're like -- I don't know what it is. Like, Thanksgiving? -Exactly. -Like a Turkey Bowl or something? -Exactly. -Yeah. -Just excited we got costumes and we can look like football players. -Yeah. Here's you and your brother at this year's Super Bowl. -Alright, now. -Yeah. All the cameras got you right there saying, \"Hey, I love you, bro.\" [ Cheers and applause ] And I also got to give a shout-out. Your mom has been the cutest for this whole ride, 'cause everyone is like, \"Who are you rooting for? What son do you like better?\" You know, all that stuff. And she's been so cool. And I've got to show you the jacket. Here's what Mama Kelce was wearing. -Split right down the middle right there. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [ Cheers and applause ] You see the red side's on that left right there. -Yeah. -It's right there next to that heart. She knows. Mama knows best. Mama knows best. -I mean, mama knows best. -That right shoe looked way better than the left shoe. No offense, guys. No offense, guys. -I know this is tough for The Roots to be -- 'Cause they're just such Philly fans. But you know what? No one picked -- Look at this. No one picked you guys to win at all, none of the experts. -The experts. -The experts. -The experts say that, yeah, the Chiefs were out of it way back in April, I think. We lost a big-name wide receiver, one of my favorite teammates ever, Tyreek Hill, and they thought that it was just -- it was over for us. And that's why being on that mountaintop, man, it just felt that much sweeter, man. -But did you feel -- [ Cheers and applause ] 'Cause watching the Super Bowl, I thought you were out. I've got to be honest. I mean, that second half and when Patrick started limping off the field, I go, \"Oh, gosh.\" -10-point lead, man. Don't give Pat Mahomes 10 points, because he will just floor it. -Really? He's like, \"Don't tell me no.\" -Yeah, he got -- It will probably go down as one of my favorite speeches. At halftime, he got electric, man. He lit a fire in everybody's tail just to, you know, want it that much more. And when you can do that with a group of men, man, that's a special human being right there. -Yeah, and you got everyone hyped up and you came back. It was an unbelievable comeback. -Second half was a lot of energy, man. A lot of energy. A lot of passion. -We have a big announcement that we're going to announce here on the show tonight. I'm very excited about this. You're going to be back in our building in a few weeks. Can you say why you're coming back? -Yeah, for sure. I mean, growing up, I was a huge, like, Farley, Ferrell, Fallon kind of guy growing up. And, yeah, I used to watch \"Saturday Night Live\" with my mother. And it's an absolute honor and a privilege to be hosting \"SNL\" March 4th. [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ -Come on, buddy! Come on, bud! Yes! It's going to be great! It's going to be great! -I am so nervous for that. Oh, my gosh. -You are going to be so good. I was talking to Lorne today. I'm like, \"Oh, he's so charming and he can sing and he's fun.\" And it's so good. -You think that about me? -I do. Yeah. -Thanks, man. -I know. Yeah, yeah. I do. -You're making me blush, man. -Oh, it's amazing. But Kelsea Ballerini is musical guest. -Yes. Yes. -So it's going to be a hot show. Congratulations on that. -Thank you very much. -You know, it's interesting that -- I was just -- It's interesting that I brought up singing, because I know that you do some karaoke. And -- [ Cheers and applause ] -How did you know? -It's kind of out there. -How'd it get out there? -There was one song that has been very important to you during this playoff run, and I thought maybe, if we can convince you... [ Cheers and applause ] We've got The Roots. We've got the best in the business right there. -Fellas, do you mind? ♪♪ Kick it!

And so I switched my phone off 2015 and left it in a box. And then, when I went through that lawsuit, I got my phone out again and had to go through, like, all the voice notes and the pictures and all that stuff for the lawyers. And I switched it on, and it was like going into a time machine. Like, the first text was my friend that had passed away the year before. The second text was, like, an argument with an ex-girlfriend. The third text was a family member I hadn't spoken to in 10 years. Fourth text was another mate that died. And I was kind of, like, scrolling down. It really, really spun me out. And, that day, I wrote in my notes, like, \"I found my old phone today,\" and then, \"Finish this as a song.\" And then I ended up writing it into a song that that's the music video for, essentially. -Well, we always happen to have a guitar handy. -I did spot that. -Yeah. -Yeah. -If you ever feel the need to pick it up... -I haven't, um...

particular pair of Jordans yeah vinyl records you know that whole thing it's it's it's a big change when I was 12 years old I still wanted toys no it's a toy it's a non-toy scenario now and then and then there's a party cool he's got he's going to see scissor tonight that's how cool he is [Applause] imagine that imagine your 12th birthday go to see scissor at The Forum my my actual first concert I think I was 15 and it was Weird Al Yankovic at the Oregon State Fair well that tracks yeah that tracks yeah I stopped having birthday parties when I was nine why yeah because I just wanted we didn't have like a lot of money and I just wanted to go to the theater so my mum and dad were like look theater tickets are expensive so that will be everything like there won't be a party there won't be anything else but then we'd go to the theater and my sisters would go and I'd be like well [Applause] they're still having a party and getting to see Starlight Express time it's time time views Donald Trump and his advisors reportedly spent today awaiting a potential indictment with one advisor saying the former president has quote resigned himself to the possibility now look it's not the way we wanted to use the words Trump and resigned combined but we'll take it thank you this meant to happen yesterday like seriously they're stretching this out like it's the you know the end of like the final of American Idol it's time to find out whether or not Trump is getting arrested Trump is gonna find out after this break don't go anywhere now according to reports Trump has told his inner circle that he actually wants to be handcuffed and do a perp walk it's true Trump believes that since he would need to surrender himself to authorities anyway he might as well turn it into a spectacle I mean I get it why not sure what I mean he already moves his hands like he's wearing handcuffs you know it's not going to be a big adjustment moving on President Biden will be leaving for Ottawa tomorrow to spend two days meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau although a good chunk of the trip will be used for a trump indictment viewing party what right now I've been thinking about this I really like President Biden I'm a huge fan I really really like him what's going on what's he doing excuse he's got a lot of time he's with Niall Horan last week he's with the Ted lasso cast on Tuesday is it Bruce Springsteen and Julia Louis Dreyfus yesterday pressing political issue is he going to address in Canada like we're going to tune in like next week he'll be tackling climate change with Justin Bieber and Celine Dion he's got more guests than we do he's getting Heavy Hitters you got to run for president dude I don't think I can I don't think I can I don't think I can can I because I'm going wrong you're not the first group of people who've come up um but I don't think I can can I why I think it's I'm because I'm British oh yeah do people know that about you that I'm pretty yeah no I highlighted pretty well thank you yeah I think you just reintroduced yourself you know Jim Gordon how the hell are you your way should you make those words a big cowboy hat yeah big Bell Amarillo Texas yeah and I've got a really really really firm handshake yeah like kind of handshake the other person the other person's like whoa yeah one of the key topics of discussion is reportedly modernizing the North American Aerospace Defense command which is a very fancy way of saying we're shooting down more of those Dagon balloons and according to a new study listen to this who's American in here put your hands up if you're an American okay well get ready American IQ scores have dropped for the first time in a century this is it makes sense no no sir no sir this is it this is our show's Legacy and I could not be more proud now I don't want to make this personal I don't know why I want to make this personal at all but if I'm honest right Ian I saw this happen to you in real time what what can we do to get the scores back up I don't know dude five years ago I might have had the answer but uh I am dumb as hell I mean for the first time in a century American IQ scores have fallen and when asked for comment most Americans were like what now I was on Tick Tock and the bank JP Morgan Chase had an unpleasant surprise recently they found out that the 1.3 million dollars worth of precious metal that they were storing in a secure Warehouse was actually just bags filled with rocks yeah more encouraging news from the banking sector it might be the saddest way to end any story am I in it yeah it turns out it's just a bag of rocks yeah and I thought I found the love of my life turns out it was just a bag of rocks honey have found our dream house sorry I got it's just a bag of rocks now the bags are supposed to be full of nickel and the bank has no idea how the bags got switched out which makes this situation actually historic it's the first time anyone has ever wanted Nickelback foreign I don't want to include myself in this because I'm not American so I I don't have any beef I don't have any beef in this I have no skin in this game you all decided you didn't like him I think they're great I don't understand baby came up I understand the beef here they became a hard punch line here but if you get yourself anywhere between four and 16 beers deep and this is how you remind me comes on you're not having a bad time I would argue that's true of a lot of their music I actually think it's I think it's John I I genuinely mean this like it's just a pylon yeah on Nickelback and I don't like it yeah I think I think part of the blowback is Binger was a adult man with curly blonde hair and like early yeah it's kind of curly here kind of curly he looked like a Labradoodle wavy now can we bring up a photo the lead singer and Nickelback I don't think it was Curly yeah that's a wave that's okay I know but he's got like if you put Shakira's face on his head it would look the same that's Shakira here but what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with I just think you've all gone too far Shakira's head that's fine but I'm the guy from Nickelback very similar I like I like Shakira a little bit Shakira looks great well I'll answer this question yeah you've never seen Shakira and Nickelback in the same room moving on a list has come out of the best and worst tourist attractions in the world any guesses what do we think band what do we think was the what was the best spot tourist attraction what do we reckon uh the the Library of Alexandria the Library of Alexandria the pyramids Hollywood is the worst like Chinese Theater area right yeah I think that was the worst that's of course oh who's at Disneyland there's like oh there you go you're well I can tell you the top three tourist attractions uh include the Blue Lagoon in Iceland Disneyland in Paris and the Hungarian Parliament building small kids we're taking a trip to the Hungarian Parliament building right I've been I've been to Disneyland Paris and for the life of me I cannot work out how it made the top three it's I honestly I'm using the word it is a disgrace it's a disgrace to the legacy of Mickey Mouse what is what is so bad are the rides bad what's so bad about it it's the rides a fine Space Mountain good everything else is just because it's like you know people don't really the greatest thing about going to this land is people are like hey kids and everything's great they usually someone going no closed [Applause] any idea when it might reopen no and now you're saying that that's like that's Goofy now this is true Hagar you'll like this one you were bang on right the Hollywood Walk of Fame came in deadlocked yeah yeah does the Hungarian Parliament building have Antonio banderas's name written on it I don't mean so I don't even the Hollywood Walk of Fame isn't even an attraction it's just a sidewalk it depends on what you're looking for out of a tourist experience it's small like you're part of this world it's beautiful you gotta like you know Niagara Falls the Blue Mountains in Sydney right exactly and if you want to have like someone in an Elmo costume give you hepatitis yeah and did you hear about these scientists at Columbia University have created the world's first 3D printed cheesecake the cheesecake was assembled entirely by a 3D printing machine while simultaneously being cooked by lasers here it is here look at that yeah because that's that's what we all look for in a cheesecake a crunchy crust that goes all the way around it now I'm sure this tastes delicious but you've got to admit nothing beats the taste of Grandma's home 3D printing a printed cheesecake cooked by lasers think about it we as a society are on the cusp of creating a literal Cheesecake Factory and that's your mind when we come back everybody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

the southern hospitality is a real thing so that's glorious [Applause] we'll come back on a Monday I'll ask reg what he did and it's something so glamorous and gorgeous and I can watch the light just fade in your eyes as you realize as she realized I'm gonna turn this way and you're gonna say spent a lot of time on the couch yeah yeah smoked a pork butt though got the Big Green Egg fired up dude oh no no no sorry I thought that was slang I thought that was slang for some news smoking some new strain of weed that I don't know about is that what they call it a pork butt they call it pork butt even though it's the pork shoulder and yes we should spend 15 minutes talking about this right now it's that time it's time for the news of course last night was the Academy Awards that everybody was did you see it the brilliant show lovely evening went by without controversy it was a very different feeling in the room from last year although I was tense I was still tense I was just I was waiting for Bill Nye and Austin Butler to get in some kind of shoving match Steven Spielberg The Lean Forward give John Williams a wet willy nothing how did you do in your Oscar's pool oh dude I crushed it last night yeah everyone crushed it no one was surprised by anything I got in the wheel I actually blew some of the bigger categories where if I would have picked with my head I would have done even better but I was picking like best Oscar short animated short hadn't seen any of them just went off name alone right and you when you kind of came through I did I picked like there was some short film called like the uh the Irish and I was like well it's a big night for the Irish because of the bases of energy well good for you I mean obviously the big winner was everything everywhere all at once taking home seven Oscars including best picture best director and best original screenplay it also took home the Oscar for that movie that makes you realize that maybe the edible you took was too strong fun fact this is the first Best Picture Winner to prominently feature hot dog fingers since 1996 is The English Patient for the first time in 60 years nominees entered on something other than a red carpet organizers opted instead for a champagne carpet yeah well they say it's champagne it sounds fancy between you and me it's actually just a Prosecco carpet it's true they did it they said they did it to evoke peacefulness implying that last s just red carpet was what enraged Will Smith there was some incredible Oscar Fashions last night here's Florence Pugh walking the champagne carpet she looks amazing she looks absolutely incredible although she also looks how I look when I'm in a hotel and room service shows up earlier than I thought and I have to use a bed sheet no no it's I'm coming I'm coming I love it look at that it says glamor it says Hollywood it says I can be ready for a game of volleyball in seconds Questlove showed up wearing diamond encrusted Crocs putting diamonds onto Crocs is basically like putting caviar on a chili dog yeah Diamonds Are Made anything look fancy I'm just going to get a little bag of diamonds and instead of dressing up for events I'm just going to glue the diamonds to sweatpants and I'll be right there here's the rock in a pink tuxedo jacket yeah well you're whooping I hope nobody needs a prom dress this year because that jacket single-handedly depleted the nation's pink style in reserves okay he looks like if your Grandma's favorite chair grew legs and walked through the Oscars now I don't know if you saw this but Hugh Grant gave an interview to Ashley Graham last night and he was absolutely delighted to be there are you excited to see anybody win do you have your hopes up for anyone um not not no one in particular what are you wearing tonight then adjust my suit how fun is it to shoot something like that well I'm barely in it I'm in it for about three seconds yeah but still you showed up and you had fun right uh almost oh yeah I love it he's at the Academy Awards you should be treating this like one of the Four Weddings not the funeral because you the thing here is you've got to match the question to the person you know you can ask Timothy chalamet what he's wearing you've got to ask Hugh Grant what he thinks about the 18th century poet William Blake's theory that the human imagination is proof of the Divine your nominee Thames made things very very people sitting behind her in the auditorium because well she wore this I mean those poor people sat behind her hello if someone's wearing that in front of you I do think it's totally acceptable to just cut out two eye holes so you can see everyone looks like they're at the Oscars Thames looks like she's at a meeting of the galactic Senate Paul Rogers won for best uh he won the best editing award for everything everywhere all at once and he gave a very chill speech mentioning how he's winning an Oscar for only his second ever movie uh too much this is my second film y'all this is crazy first off that man is too handsome to be locked away in a dark room editing isn't he can't be an editor I see this guy I don't I don't know him but I see this guy a lot he's got major hot dad at a trendy preschool energy do you know what I mean he isn't winning an Oscar that guy's picking up his son who's called like Jagger or Fox while drinking a nine dollar cup of pour over coffee just Lady Gaga yeah we have we have pretty hot editors you know yeah maybe Adam maybe editors are just hot can I be honest yeah I think we as a group right right as a group of men yeah in a workplace right are not that hot I'm including I'm including all I mean like I'm I'm putting myself way down I'm not dissing and I'm saying as a group just as a group I don't think anyone walks into the offices of The Late Late Show and goes goes for a hot Bunch this is yeah but I'm not saying we're unattracted I'm just saying yes our editors are not unattractive yeah but I think we as a species within the show have lowered the bar you know what I mean take Guillermo out the band the band becomes a cry for help [Applause] oh man you know again no disrespect pictures of the editors have we got pictures of the editors I don't think any of them have got online profiles cheers a lot of that is that or Ford fraudulent Behavior you know yeah [Music] right that's a good one that's a proper hot dude that's a hot guy bro I'm I'm with you I just I'm saying we're looking at it it's like if we all did if we all did the long jump yeah no one would be good at the long jump but someone would win it is you know snake someone somebody would jump the furthest and we go wow that was amazing you won the long jump they didn't win anything they'd be this I just you're making me feel insane right now because I think we're all like hot dude hot dude hot dude hot dude hot dude hot dude I look in the mirror and I can't tell if Pedro Pascal broke into my house or what's going on correct we've gone way off track yeah Lady Gaga performed her oscar-nominated song Hold My Hand from Top Gun Maverick and for the first 45 seconds the camera was very zoomed in have a look I wrote this song with my friend blood pop for the film top gun Maverick and my studio basement [Applause] it's deeply personal for me and I think that we all need each other [Laughter] I mean it was zoomed in So Close you could see everything unless of course you were sat behind Thames then you couldn't see anything I mean it's an interesting choice isn't it bold but like you could you it's certainly Brave so make yourself that vulnerable do you know what I mean like I know I would be I would be nervous that's not something I would ever feel confident of no way Tim wait what are you doing no no I love that she starts that with I wrote this with my friend blood pop blood pop no blood pop oh hey guys you've done this is um this is Chris Andy Neil Simon blood pop David friend blood is that a basement with a basement either way either way you've got hundreds of millions of dollars I'm sure you could be in a studio there isn't in a basement oh it's where blood pops happiest cool be safe uh and if you watched I'm sure you noticed this the the academy tried to get more people uh to to learn more by flashing scannable QR codes on the screen they even did it after the in memoriam section now when you when you scan the QR code you only have to watch two tasteful Dr Pepper ads before seeing who else had died last year no one watching the Oscars is pulling out their phone to scan a QR code mostly because they're already on their phone phones Googling how to get ozempic this odd moment Melissa McCarthy and Hallie Bailey uh took to the stage as if they were presenting an awards and then they just showed an ads on ABC for their parent company Walt Disney have a look so we are so excited to give you the first look at our upcoming film coming to theaters May 26th they should have just gone all in pulled out an envelope and everything and like and the Oscar for the next commercial goes to The Little Mermaids that's strange I think they've done that before have they 've done an ad in the show I think it's a little tasteless to run an art in the middle of a TV show you know anyway Keurig Brew the love and did you catch this during his acceptance speech the producer of everything everywhere all at once meant to say no prophets are more important than a person but got a little mixed up no person is more important than Prophets yeah all the all the producers the studio hits their heads in the room were like finally someone said it was all the speeches last night were about the power of film and how dreams can come true it was nice to finally hear something honest there were a lot of exciting wins some incredible speeches last night there really well but no one was more shocked and overcome with excitement than Jamie Lee Curtis here she is here now she's really excited do you think she's making that face because she's one but look who was sat in front of her and at the end of the night there was this touching moment when kihi Guan hugged Harrison Ford after Ford presented the Best Picture award it was an incredibly sweet moment and reminded a lot of people of Quan's first role in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom look at that [Applause] spring in Harrison Ford's ear who's the Short Round now and that's the news [Applause] music starting tomorrow night tomorrow night this is our first carport in how long Rob about eight months in eight

time for this show how you doing coms all good yeah I'm good yeah yeah I went to Burbank I got a text from Ian last night like 8 45 it just said I'm watching Jerry Maguire yeah when their wives are out of town 100 yeah so but you said you had you had some real Solitude I didn't speak to anyone that entire day until we talked yeah yeah and you just lent into it you lent into the silence and what did you find out about yourself that uh deep down at the at the very core right in there of who I am right down in the granular base level we're pretty boring guy it's that time it's time for the news and later this week President Biden will be releasing his budget but his administration is already leaking the fact the Biden will propose a tax increase to keep Medicare solvent practically daring Republicans to come out against it because nothing says don't worry you'll still be okay when you retire like an 80 year old president who refuses to retire keeping Medicare solvents keeping Medicare solvent it's not exciting but it's important it's the weeknight sex of politics Biden's budget will propose raising attacks on Americans earning more than four hundred thousand dollars it's a brilliant idea from a guy who coincidentally makes exactly four hundred thousand dollars in other news Donald Trump's attorneys are asking to delay the trial date of the former president's fraud case because they say the New York attorney general has so much evidence they can't review it all in time apparently there are 2.6 million pages of evidence yeah see when you think about it these are the documents that Trump should have stolen [Applause] it's thought about it I love how Trump's I love how Trump's defense team is like there's so much evidence of fraud we don't even have enough time to review it also he's innocent it's a it's a pretty smart strategy by Trump this it is commits so much fraud that by the time they're ready for trial you'll be president of the United States again and it'll and according to his allies Donald Trump is currently testing out new nicknames for his chief Republican rival Governor Ron DeSantis while he seems to be set on Rhonda sanctimonious he's also considering Ron dishonest Ron D establishments and Tiny d nice to see Trump laser focused on the most important issues of the day isn't it tiny D makes it sound like he's going to release a song with DJ Khaled Khalid ice spice and Tiny d what happened to meatball wrong was that wrong DeSantis apparently Trump never came up with meatball Ron and it just got out there but which is too big because it is I think you should see should run the whole way with meatball runs yeah you should call him Ron Ron DNC to associate him with the wow and with Run DMC or tiny ball oh what sorry oh tiny balls tiny balls tiny balls tiny balls just call him tiny balls I I I'm not mad at it I'm not mad at it it's [Music] you know when everyone says Napoleon was really short like you know he was a he was above average height right right and that was just all propaganda if he went with tiny balls it's very difficult for Ron DeSantis to come out and go I have regular sized balls tiny balls oh tiny bowls but he could even go one further Big D tiny balls because that's that's the worst if you've got a big like little like Tic Tacs in a regular sack the sack's not small it's the balls [Applause] and have you seen this and have you seen this wax figures of Prince William and Princess Kate have gone viral after a tick tocker recently posted a clip from quote the worst Wax Museum in Poland for a reminder here's the actual Prince and Princess of Wales just here and here are the wax versions yeah that whacks Prince William looks like he just walked in it looks like he just walked into Prince Andrew's room by mistake what's happened to this they look like their bodies were just lifted out of the Titanic although on the plus side at least we all know now what they both look like if they got infected in The Last of Us those two photos side by side are perfect it's like it's like when the edible hits mean can help Men last three times longer in bed yeah I'll tell you something this is the first time in the history of this show that my wife has texted me a news story maybe you could use this for the show now in some cases it just seemed longer because the men wouldn't shut up about going oh my God yoga will change your eyes this is true after 12 weeks of yoga the time went from an average of just under 26 seconds to almost a minute and a half 26 seconds I didn't realize this was a study of tantric sex you've ever giving it a go yoga no I probably should I'm getting tight yeah I got a bad back right now yeah I had to go I I tried yoga and I fell asleep completely true story that completely true story because the guy was just like look it's just this is all about small gains just over time this is where you just like lie down breathe and then I was out yeah that's completely asleep and uh and he got like annoyed with me the the dude got annoyed and I was like you just said to just completely relax you know if you don't like yoga you have you tried frozen yogurt some days I sit and I think well should we end the show like is this silly walking out on you know the best moment of your life and then there's moments like that and I think no no it's 100 time um we wanted to

Jones is pregnant no because 2012 he was born okay he was born in 2011. he's 12 in March he was born in 2011 which means she was pregnant so it was Christmas 2010 which puts it Rob 12 13 years ago [Music] [Applause] [Music] she was she was pregnant because he opened this wine I remember George going I really want something anyway this has really gone off track it's such a boring story it's irrelevant now cute you get boring absolutely what did you eat though what did you make so we had to we were late because we had to go somewhere else and Gordon said don't you worry I'm gonna cook you your own Beef Wellington yeah and he did they were eating something else and we got there and it was oh so beautiful it was glorious and when was this again foreign [Applause] last night right here in Los Angeles because LeBron James broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38-year record to become the NBA NBA time a leading scorer I know you're watching the game stopped for 10 minutes while LeBron celebrated it was just enough time for Kareem to step onto the court make a layup and take the title back again I've got to say I was watching it last night as a man in my 40s it was very depressing it was deeply depressing to hear the announcers talk about it they were like it's unbelievable he said 30 years old he's ancient older than time itself it's a miracle the man can even walk at this age here's LeBron on the court thanking the fans and his teammates man thank you guys thank you I'm glad you did it that way around it's way better than going thanks man you guys you break the NBA all-time scoring record you should get to swear on television whenever you want for the rest of your life it's fine you can be like my name's LeBron James I think you should drink a Gatorade now of course the big push from last night was President Biden delivered his State of the Union Address the speech was the longest of Biden's presidency at 73 minutes but honestly it was so fun and fast-paced it really only felt like 71 minutes this is true Biden spoke 9191 words beating Bill Clinton's 1995 speech by one word Biden was like see LeBron ain't the only Legend sharing records tonight the Knight got off to an odd start with first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug emhoff greeting each other by kissing fully on the lips look at that the state of the union is extremely horny again it's an awkward moment all eyes are on you you know the pressure to look normal is so high and you go and accidentally kiss the president's wife on the lips now Jill Biden actually had Bono there as a guest um but here he is right here look at Bono there I love that he's watching and clapping like oh yeah slip a tongue in man slippery tongue you know what happened I think he popped a Bono before Biden even had a chance to speak things got a bit contentious with the Republican Mitt Romney telling Republican George Santos in a tense exchange you don't belong here here they are just here look at that Mitt Romney rolling with some real vice principal at high school rally energy it's a very awkward exchange Romney introduced himself like excuse me I'm selling a Mitt Romney and Santos was like no I think you'll find I'm Senator Mitt Romney but when he walked in when he walked in you could tell you could tell Mitt Romney was ready for a fight he had the smell of whole milk on his breath foreign Cinema stood out in the crowd with her outfit a bright yellow dress with poofy shoulders Biden showed up to deliver the State of the Union speech and Kirsten Cinema showed up as I assumed to deliver a bridesmaid speech hello cousin she is a very accomplished woman capable woman a sitting U.S senator it isn't fair to reduce her to the clothing she wears but this is a late night talk show and she showed up to the State of the Union dressed like a piece of bow tie pasta thank you we can't knock their enemy we have to say something we have to look you all know this about me Ian I'm not afraid to talk politics what's your favorite pasta dish you can't be able to catch you a Pepe just felt like it's a bit I catch you it's easy to do bad it's easy pepper cheese and egg in it right and if you can make those three ingredients sing brother you got something going and I'll give you that yeah what's your favorite part I like a papa Deli yeah exactly I enjoy saying it yeah I enjoy eating it it's all spicy right Papa Deli I like a papa Deli Ragu yeah daily yeah is that how you'd say it's a butterfly that's what you know they love that in Italian restaurants when you do an Italian accent what about you what about you reg go to go to Pasta you're in an Italian restaurant probably okay throughout the speech or I just jump in I I have to mention it because it's also very good it's also very good but it's a potato based pasta folks it's one of those throughout the speech House Republicans put the spotlight on themselves with booze taunts Grunts and sarcastic chortles here's the moment when things got really contentious some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security Sunset I'm not saying it's a majority let me give you anybody who doubts it contact my office I'll give you a copy I'll give you a copy of The Proposal look at find these absolutely loving it he's this close because this ghost is stepping away from the podium being like Oh what it did get Rowdy It Go Rowdy one Republican he even screamed we want Jill and Doug to kiss again foreign Republican Marjorie Taylor green kept standing up Republican Martin Taylor green kept standing up and booing the president throughout the speech at one point even yelled a liar out of force of habit George Santos immediately jumped up and was like no I'm not here she is during one of her outbursts look at that if you're gonna if you're gonna Heckle the president definitely do it while you're dressed like a Disney villain foreign Taylor green now includes President Biden and every bartender at any TGI Fridays ma'am I'm sorry I'm cutting you off you've had enough like boom try to use the opportunity to trap Republicans into keeping Social Security and Medicare intact have a look folks as we all apparently agree Social Security Medicare is off the off the books now right all right that's oh that's how you get Jill back I'm such a crowd pleaser I wouldn't be surprised if President Biden opens every meeting with Social Security and Medicare or off the books now you're like uh sir that you're pardoning a turkey for the most part Biden stuck to the prepared speech except at one point he got very worked up talking about being in competition with China name me a world leader who changed places with Xi Jinping name me one name me one oh I don't know I don't like it when he does that it gives me like pop quiz vibes no I'm there like oh I said name you why is it Justin Trudeau I'm gonna say final answer just intro why is he so angry about it does he think the US is trying to trade him to China like it's a sports team overall Biden's message was clear and forceful or at the very least it was forceful make no mistake if you try anything to raise the cost of Brazilian jobs I will Victor so what was that would you say can you repeat that raise the cost of reasons it's a good strategy just keep guessing but I think so what hey that's what Biden to know and you to find out look at vice president Karma Harris in the back straight up that's a true friend she's like didn't understand the word but I'm coming anyway on that note I am James Corden and that that was the first we'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

      "page_content": "thank you hey gang how are you um thanks for this here's the news I've I've signed a new contract with the Late Late Show um and it will be my last contract that I signed as the host of this show um and the show will stop in a year's time there's two there's too many things to say there's too many things I'd like to say it's too much love for real as we come to the end of it I am unbelievably sad that it's coming to an end but also full of understanding why the time might be right to bring it to a close and just thankful for the amazing times we've all had it's set I'm sad the show's ending it's been such a great experience and it's such a wonderful group of people I'm so proud of all the work we've done here and I'm like impressed by James so like walk away and move on because it's not easy to do always always known that one day I will be stood here for the last time I think all good things need to come to an end that if you go on forever you lose what makes you special it's very rare in television that you get to call your own shots and I think it's really amazing that James he's going to go no no that's it I've done my time gratitude is is the word that comes across first you know eventually I think you'll think about the Legacy that we've left in late night which is you know 70 years worth of television and like the show's gonna stand out that phrase in The Late Late Show won't exist on CBS anymore it is a franchise that's been around for 30 years it's always sad to wind down a franchise and even though it's ending I think that it deserves its spot in the history of the format The Late Late Show starring Tom Snyder [Applause] 28 years ago I was at the very first Late Late Show with Tom Snyder and now I will be at the last Late Late Show with James Corden Tim has directed every every single episode of The Late Late Show we've got an 80 job with Tom Snyder was ad for Craig Kilbourne then became deck director of Craig Ferguson and is now the director of this show right now I feel so fortunate to have been on this show for so long I mean I put 28 years into the show and started at the bottom and now to be fortunate enough to direct the show and to spend the last eight years with the most talented people the people here the environment that's been created is far greater than anything we have ever put on screen this is a real family unit of people who really love working here they love each other it's a really beautiful experience that I think will be hard to rival the fundamental thing that I will miss more than anything I've got to go to work with absolute friends and make friendships that I will carry the rest of time TV is one of those jobs where when you're in production it's kind of unlike many others because it's so intense doing a late night show is like sprinting a marathon it is exhausting and it is like never ending you're working with people all hours day every day for so many years so it's obviously very sad and to say goodbye to all these people because it's been such a family for so long we're not leaving today we still have a year to go and I am we are all determined to make this the best year we have ever had making this show we are going to go out with a bang that's going to be carpools and crosswalks and sketches the thing as we're coming to the end of the show it's hard to believe that we're here already but I think it's really really important how things end I think it's really important that things end in the manner that they began 48 shows ago so I guess it's just how do we make sure that these last 48 shows are like the best ones we do and we just do everything that we can do to make these shows as memorable as they possibly can be that's what today's about a way to be away from the studio and to really just put these Brilliant Minds together and think about what we can do James has done a lot of things that Tom Cruise to a musical you my boy are in the theater James would integrate Tom Cruise into the musical make him do like a tap okay well there is something really funny in the theory of that I've done loads of you like I've jumped out of planes I've done this I've read and I've done this I've done that now it's time for you to do stuff that I like and it's like all that stuff we will perform live in The Lion King it's it's just crazy I mean you have Maverick standing there like giving you two days to shoot a lion king thing we're not young what Tom Cruise is someone who pushes us to be the best that we can because he wants everything to be as good as it can be and it's time for our last adventure together and I there's really no need for us to be friends after you've finished it you look me in the eyes and tell me I'm wrong when Mission Impossible 17 comes out you're not gonna you're not gonna think of me now you're not gonna think of me you're going to be off base jumping with bow and yang it is he's one of the stars that puts so much into it that it really makes everyone be on top of their game and we want to be the best we can for him and he's the best he can be for us you all have brought so much joy to so many people you're so enormously talented and I always have an incredible time and I'm telling you this is not the end of our creative relationship he's a mate I mean he's amazing I love you too so we should also think about some of our like Classic Bits carpool and be like who haven't we done yet as we'll do Bad Bunny we'll do that when I was ex James is there a crosswalk you want to do before it ends I'm Singing in the Rain we're looking oh yeah the other day is Hollywood yeah it's about Hollywood crosswalk is one of our biggest and most ambitious pieces that we do when it first started there's an idea by our co-head writer Ian Carmel which was let's just put on a show on the crosswalk crosswalk started as like a small production it was like James a few other actors leather jackets and like not a whole lot of props and over the years it's evolved and evolved and we've had Stars such as Will Smith and the cast of Beauty and the Beast and Adina Menzel running out onto a crosswalk singing songs in front of actual traffic and then running off across walking we flew to Paris Indiana we've done it in New York London like it's become like a gigantic bed it's funny and big and ambitious and everything we've tried to do and it's so much fun to produce it is the fun crosswalk the joy we have had making magic pushing the envelope it's just been a dream come true and I'm so thankful for James Corden and your huge vision and the entire team foreign [Applause] we're here to tell you you can't just leave a talk show another life goes on WE James and then what follows is like a grilling about leaving late night if we're gonna let you leave we need to know you'll keep our sacred secrets and then what do you know you know that we don't actually read the books we know that we've never watched any of the movies you know that we don't find any of the jokes funny the fake laugh we all have for when a guest tells a story that isn't funny maybe they cut off a finger I have as many as we wanted in that sketch sort of the late popping on Darkness you can shoot them all over the place yeah I think it's brilliant God did speak to me and he told me I don't need to be in this bit it's essentially the sketch we did on episode one where James is like learning how to video What It Takes probably not but it's the end of it now you're leaving and this is what happens to you it has been an honor to share this time slot with you for the last eight years you have done so many inventive things with this format that nobody did before and you're really going to be missed it was great having you in this family I always like this song you did at the end of episode one yes and I think that might also be an effective sweet way of ending the 1237 version of our show on our last day my name is James Corden and tonight's who dreams came true to look like I can play piano and to host this show for you so good night thanks for watching that's our show it feels a bit like you know when you watch those like slow motion videos of a crash test dummy where you absolutely know what's coming but it's still like 25 shows away or whatever so like the damage is sort of going like this and you're like oh you're about to have a real impact something's coming it's going it just takes ages before their face like and then suddenly they just go it feels like that you're like strapped in looking at everyone you love and you're driving the car that's how it feels I'm really really just trying to keep it together realize what a privilege it is to say goodbye in the manner that we are right now I'm really proud that we went 100 for the entire run of this show from day one starting with Tom Hanks doing roll call to you know the very last show where we have Tom Cruise doing The Lion King it has been 100 miles an hour I think the last show will say it all it will be exactly like the first it will be entertaining joyful and everything [Music] foreign",

model railroad and find it I find it extremely relaxing uh those are the correct answers yes [Applause] welcome back now I've been I've been thinking for a while the last few weeks about what I was going to say as we come to the end of the show after this this wonderful adventure and and I have uh if I wanted to I've I've struggled at times I've I've struggled to find the words to sum up what this past eight years has meant to me it is almost impossible I I frankly I don't know where to start but I sit here now today with nothing but love gratitude and pride this show is everything it is everything I ever wanted it to be and uh I've got to tell you if you if you like this show and you're tuned in here in the in the middle of the night or online I cannot stress enough that I am I am just one part of a big team who make this show this incredible family here who have made The Late Late Show and so many of our team here they started this show on day one and here we are 1200 shows later and I would like to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who works on this show from the bottom of my heart for the love and the dedication that you have given to making this show what it is today I love every single one of you I will forever be in your corner always always always I told you last night this was never my show this was never my show it was ours and I'm gonna miss every single don't this time I'm gonna miss every single one of you so much I wanna I wanna if you let me I want to say uh a huge thank you to Reggie in the band um when um when Reggie said that he'd that he'd come and he'd join the show it changed everything for me it really really did it changed it was the first time that I thought we might actually be able to do something new and fresh and I love you so much man I love you I thank you for taking a leap with me on this and for putting together this unbelievable band to Hagar Guillermo Tim and Steve I could never have imagined it would have been this great and over the past few years Ian you were you were I can't look at you while I say this if that's all right you Ian you were the second writer that we hired on this show and from the minute we met I was like I think I've just met the funniest person I will ever meet in my life and you have never ever let me down and I'm so lucky that you and Lauren are the head writers here because both of you your work your dedication your your precision and your skill has been incredible and I can't thank you both enough um we are very very lucky to be on a network like CBS I cannot express how fantastic they have been with me from day one it's unfathomable why they took a chance on me to do this job I will never understand it but they have supported and they have loved this show and I will be forever grateful for what they've done for me and my family it's been uh it's been life-changing it really has because moving here to America moving here to America eight years ago it was a huge leap for me my family my son was three her daughter was 12 weeks old and we now have another small person and she's American yeah we uh you know we started this show we started with Obama then Trump then a global pandemic and and I've watched I've watched America change a lot over these past few years I've watched I've watched divisions grow and and I've seen and I've felt a sense of negativity bubble and it points boil over and I guess all I really want to say tonight is I implore you to remember what America signifies to the rest of the world my entire life it has always been a place of optimism and joy and yes it has flaws so many but show me a country that doesn't show me a person that doesn't me you all of us we are all trying to figure this out we are every single one of us a work in progress and just because somebody disagrees with you it doesn't make them bad or evil we are all more the same than we are different and there are so many people there are so many people who are who are trying to stoke those differences and we have to try as best we can to look for the light look for the joy because if you do it's out there and that's all this show has ever been about all we've ever wanted is just be a little a little bit of light and levity at the end of your day thank you for letting me do this thank you for letting me into your home every night I've never taken for granted what an absolute privilege this has been now look when we come back when we come back you are gonna be absolutely shocked at how we are going to end this show guess what we're going to end with a song I know what are the chances come on back everybody [Applause] [Music] now the last guest has gone from the Green Room and our last conversation is done the final rehearsal is over and the final commercial has run no more late late Tinder for swiping no more torturous games for a laugh no more risking my life on a fighter jet or learning too much about our staff squeezing myself into Spanx every night for 1200 times in a row so good night thanks for watching that's our show [Music] [Applause] lost karaoke's been coupled and we all came along for the right the Lost spill your Cuts has been swallowed and I'm still feeling nauseous inside and soon I will head home to London but I'll sure miss it here in L.A the weather my friends and those micro green salads I claim that I eat every day and Reggie will no longer ask people questions that aren't the least bit apropos what is the nature of time as always night thanks for watching it's our show that's our show that producers directors designers the ones who set the lights and answer phones and do the edit writing sketches working cameras building Graphics making costumes booking Talent mixing sound and never getting any credit our show was a creation of the love and dedication shared by everyone here in the crew I'm grateful for the eight years I spent with them and the eight years I spent here with you as the end of the show Fast approaches gaze at the studio floor we filled it with thousands of moments of joy and now there won't be any more yet I know as I look in the camera for the very last time as your host that each of those thousands of moments of Joy it's the one I'll remember the most and part of me thinks why not stay here forever but deep in my heart I just know almost shows to be showing time I was going it's time [Music] thanks for watching that's our show thank you so much for your time everybody I will miss you good night [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

because I have been the beneficiary of this any cool points with your children that you're here with Billy eilish today Major I just got like street cred for the rest of my life because Philly was so crazy because your daughter's here today my daughter got to meet Billy backstage oh I'm I'm I'm gonna be cool now for a little while thanks to you thank you yeah that's amazing now Billy I want to talk to you about this we spoke about this briefly in your jersey room now you were 15. it's true when you had your TV debut performing ocean eyes on our show this is us here in the dressing room before Billy went on all right that song has since been streamed 6.3 billion times to you what do you remember about what do you remember about that day I remember that I was very nervous and I was very sick and I I was sick for like many years I feel like yeah everything I did I was sick yeah um and I my voice was kind of messed up and I was just like really nervous and I just wanted to really do a good job and I remember you know you came to to meet us in the in the room and I remember it was like the first celebrity I'd ever been up close to go crazy I don't know it was amazing I was I was just like on on 10 all day it was amazing it was I remember it so vividly I don't I don't know what I think I remember just thinking oh no this is like an artist I'm going to watch the rest of my life but I remember meeting your mum meeting your brother meeting your dad I feel like this entire eight years in one way or another you or members of your family have really spanned this whole time for me and and the best thing I can say and I tried to say at the start of the show is you are exactly the same person that I met then in your core and your person truly and it's a credit to you and it's a credit to your family it really really is I mean Natalie Natalie you you achieved huge success at a very young age you've made so many iconic movies do you have a favorite film or a favorite memory from one in in this extraordinary career well I I'm sure Black Swan is like the most I've met my husband yeah um that's like the rest of my life followed because of that movie it's so brilliant it's incredible it really is you've been doing a little bit of acting please apparently please sitting here I know you ring Donald Glover's new series I was I was if you could think of a project that you want what would it be would you see Billy eilish in a rom-com would you be in a Bond movie you've already done the song for a body I know like what are we talking about what's the dream role I don't know I would have to it would have to I mean honestly swarm was kind of a dream role for me that was a big when that when that was brought up to me I was like oh this is um this is the thing this is what I want to do I mean you know Donald Glover is like my all-time hero like lifelong hero so old time wow okay sorry she's changed is what I'm saying she's safe that's me I want to talk about this you've been posting some very popular cooking videos online right they're brilliant if you were competing like on say like Top Chef or Hell's Kitchen or the Bake Off which show would Natalie Portman have the best chance of winning I'm I'm a top chef Die Hard okay I think I've watched enough that I probably I hope I've gotten something from it yeah what's your let's say let's say Billy and I are coming over because Donald Glover's busy we're coming over let's say Billy and I are coming out for dinner what do you cook what are you whipping up um maybe like a vegan couscous oh maybe no what's that face maybe you're not invited that wasn't a nice day I'm I honestly if that's the opener I'm fine things that I'm like two things what vegan and couscous but if I'm going around to Natalie Portman's I really want like a good you know like a nice little Pad Thai or something okay okay somewhere I will I will bring it I am going to go to Natalie's house thank you and I will bring a pad thai and there's no reason that the three of us can't get along and have a bloody nice time okay now Billy in amongst this extraordinary time you've just headlined Lollapalooza in South America and it's hard for anybody to get to even figure out what that is have a look this is a snippet of what the crowd was like when Billy was headlining [Music] it's amazing and you've already played a lot of festivals when it's when it's that many people how do you feel how do you feel that you're connecting with the entire audience the people that are very very bad yeah man it's hard it I mean you can't really I I find that you know I love playing festivals it's like one of my favorite types of shows to do um you know because it's just a c it's just you stand there and it's just endless people and it's really it's like a feeling that I I don't get in any other like aspect of my life it's really really incredible and it's hard to be present sometimes but I would say festivals I feel like you know it might not be all your your fans or your crowd and so I feel like I have to prove something in a way that makes me feel like I feel better like I'm like working harder I'm like do I'm putting more effort into it almost and then I also I like to go out we call it a Thrust which is like the Hat walk thing in the front and then I'll look back at the stage and I'll see myself on the Giant imags and like it feels like I'm really at the show and I'm like in the audience and I'm watching my me on stage well I want to say it's incredible and you're going to be headlining Lollapalooza again in Chicago and uh which is August 3rd and people are gonna have the greatest time stick around [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

[Applause] wow yeah as I do you know anything happened here I think we thought he was 20 and at the last moment someone's gone no no it's just been confirmed he's 21. add a one to that and someone's gone Karina's gone sure whatever National Guardsman in connection with the leaking of classified documents that were posted online the leaker is described as a lonely young man who is part of a chat room group that shares the love of guns and military gear you know how sometimes you know you find yourself going it's it's always Who You'd least suspect isn't it this isn't one of those times as a 21 year old he's devastated that this mistake May cost him his future but he's also thrilled that he's posted something online and it totally went viral he posted some of the documents in a chat room for gamers and I don't even know how this works does someone like right hey guys how do I win in fortnite and then you respond like I don't know but here's some satellite images of Ukraine meanwhile President Biden continued his tour of Ireland today meeting with President Michael D Higgins at his official residence in Dublin look at that I gotta say I Ireland's president is so adorable isn't he okay no he's a very very serious and accomplished politician but I I would like to chase him around and tickle him oh where's he going he looks like if Bernie Sanders turned into a Hobbit at one point in the state reception room Biden wrote a message in the visitors book as he sat at what can only be described as a very small desk or as president Higgins calls it it's a regular-sized desk so we're reading this earlier in the in the with all the Monarch group all the writers with we're reading this and uh and Nate Goes what did you say Nate in the writers meeting you know it just feels like we're not covering how small that desk is well enough there's a lot more to be said about how small that desk is and I said okay Nate let's see how the show's going see how the vibe is if you've got more to say on it you could say what have you got there is this the jokes that you submitted earlier this morning yes that were unfairly rejected about how small the desk is um so we had that conversation earlier and then I had them put a microphone on me and I came down here which I don't normally do but um you're normally in the car by now [Music] what is that that does James that desk is so small it looks like it belongs on The Tonight Show with tiny Timmy Fallon yep I went there and I'll go even further because that desk James is so small that even those tiny desk concerts are like we can't work with this thing I mean that desk is so small if you put a coffee cup on it the desk is like damn is this a coffee jug pages so if if we're short on Time come back to me okay if we if we if we if it lags a little I might I might just say hey Nate how small is that desk well James I mean that death is so small oh small is it now when I when I say I got it at Staples I'm talking about actual Staples thank you Nate photo everybody okay tell her Biden though Biden's having a great time on this trip isn't he on the island although at one point during his meeting with President Higgins he actually had this to say I'm not going home and this is incredible place and 70 of Americans were like okay okay seriously though you can't blame him okay like right now President Biden is out there he's in a beautiful country everybody's excited to see him and after this he has to fly back to Washington DC where Marjorie Taylor green is trying to ban oxygen because trans people breathe it in other news King Charles is hiring someone to answer his fan mail Buckingham Palace put out a job posting for an assistant correspondence officer to craft responses to each of the thousands of letters that get addressed to the king each year imagine having to respond to every piece of mail you'd be like the king would like to thank you Bed Bath and Beyond for this most generous of coupons applicants must have excellent written and verbal communication prowess strong I.T skills and the ability to discard any letter that's addressed to prince Andrew do you think I should apply for this job the timing's perfect yeah you had you had a lot of time off coming up I guess I get your what is it you you reply to letters I guess my only question is like how big is the desk you'd be sitting at the dune [Laughter] or because that that desk was so small it thinks a Post-It note a regular piece of paper and did you see this last night the Chicago Bulls played the Toronto Raptors and DeMar DeRozan's nine-year-old daughter went viral due to her high-pitched screams to distract the Raptors attempting free throws here she is here and here's the voice you're hearing when Raptors shoot she's screaming [Applause] Championship Behavior I love it I love that I do the same thing my kids are sitting in the crowd at Seth Meyer's show right now now I tell you what a strategy worked watch this official visit to Florida State basketball life is really good for him right now he's in a good headspace coming into this in terms of the total number of the quality of shots comes off [Applause] the Bulls ended up winning by four points if the Bulls win the championship she should 100 get a ring I do believe that although you watch that clip this is how you know you understand we know like people you know the games got soft you know it's got a little soft in the old days Michael Jordan would have shown up at that girl's school the next day and screamed every time she tried to answer a math problem yeah and finally Bush's beans is giving you the chance to win a free vacation to a national park where you can stay in a one-of-a-kind camper that's shaped like a giant can of beans here it is here there it is there and this is the inside you can tell it's an American promotion If This Were in Britain the bed would be a giant slice of toast it's an impressive space unfortunately you can't enter your room that's in a can of beans without one of these [Applause] everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THIS IS?\nTHE PRESIDENT IS 80 YEARS OLD.\nHE PROBABLY CLICKED ONE OF THOSE FAKE AMAZON EMAILS WHILE HE WAS\nON HIS WORK COMPUTER. BANG, THAT'S HOW THIS HAPPENS.\nTODAY, THE WHITE HOUSE HOSTED ITS ANNUAL EASTER EGG ROLL\nON THE SOUTH LAWN. AND THIS YEAR, THEY EVEN\nUNVEILED A NEW EASTER BUNNY. HERE'S THE NEW BUNNY RIGHT HERE.\nTHERE HE IS. THEY NEEDED A NEW ONE BECAUSE\nTHE PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSE EASTER BUNNY IS CURRENTLY SERVING\nNINE YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE JANUARY 6 RIOT.\nONCE AGAIN, THIS YEAR'S THEME WAS \"EGG-UCATION.\"\nALTHOUGH BIDEN ALSO MADE TIME TO ADDRESS \"THE EGG-CONOMY\" AND\nHAVE I GOT? >> Reggie: SIX MORE,\nHOPEFULLY.

HERE HE IS, SITTING IN THE FRONT\nROW WITH MIKE TYSON, KID ROCK, AND UFC PRESIDENT DANA WHITE.\nLOOK, YOU CELEBRATE THE LORD'S RESURRECTION YOUR WAY,\nLET TRUMP CELEBRATE HIS WAY. IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE CURRENT\nSTATE OF THINGS WHEN MY FIRST REACTION LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE\nIS, \"WHY IS MIKE TYSON HANGING OUT WITH SUCH A BAD\nCROWD?\" THAT'S RIGHT, MIKE TYSON,\nKID ROCK, DONALD TRUMP, AND DANA WHITE.\nIT'S THE MOUNT RUSHMORE OF [SHUDDERING]\nAND DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? OVER THE WEEKEND.\nOVER THE WEEKEND, SOME FANS WERE EJECTED FROM A LIVE THEATER\nMUSICAL PERFORMANCE OF \"THE BODYGUARD,\" AFTER LOUDLY\nSINGING ALONG TO \"I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.\"\nNOW, WE'VE GOT FOOTAGE FROM THE INCIDENT.\nYOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING, BUT BELIEVE ME YOU\nCAN HEAR IT. OKAY, BUT HOW WAS THE REST OF\nTHE BACHELORETTE WEEKEND? THAT'S HOW FAST THINGS\nCAN CHANGE. THEY WENT FROM SINGING THE\nBODYGUARD TO BEING TACKLED BY ONE.\nAND FINALLY, DOES EVERYONE REMEMBER BILLY McFARLAND,\nTHE CREATOR OF FYRE FESTIVAL, WHO WAS SENTENCED TO PRISON\nFOR FRAUD? WELL, GUESS WHAT.\nLAST NIGHT HE TWEETED: \"FYRE FESTIVAL TWO\nIS FINALLY HAPPENING. TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE\nINVITED.\" TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE\nINVITED. I LIVE MY LIFE BY ONE SIMPLE\nPHILOSOPHY. IF JA RULE IS OUT, I'M OUT.\nIT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. FYRE FESTIVAL TWO PROMISES GREAT\nMUSIC, A PARTY ATMOSPHERE. PLUS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE\nINTERVIEWED FOR MULTIPLE DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT HOW IT\nTURNED OUT TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE LINEUP? A BTS COVER BAND, A CARDBOARD\nCUTOUT OF BEYONCE, AND STEVE FROM\n\"THE LATE LATE SHOW\" BAND. AND THAT ISN'T BILLY McFARLAND'S\nONLY BIG IDEA.

played football junior high high school uh-huh yeah any good what position I well in high school uh I just wanted to like experience to say that I played High School uh football but I so I chose um I played a Right Guard because there was a deodorant at the time yeah my jersey number was 69. and uh yeah and I didn't know any of the plays so I would always ask the nose guard as we as we would break from the Huddle as we were walking to the line I would ask him what I'm supposed to do and he hated it yeah I bet you you actually I don't even know if you remember this very early in the show I think even perhaps before we'd even launched yeah it always been my theory that I was born in the wrong country and actually when I watched The Blind Side I was like I was like oh my God this this kid is me I got a good awareness and I'm light on my toes yeah that's all they kept saying light on the toes good awareness I was like had I been and I was very openly going have I been born in America I'm it's almost certain I would have been the number two or three draft pick yeah no question I think I've known you for like two months and I said and you said no way you wouldn't be able to do it and I said I'm telling you right now and you said all right and you got down in a stance we went like we were in it we were in the office we were right outside of the office kitchen we were on carpet I can block you we got down and he just pounded me into a wall and I was like okay yeah you're right that's not it's not my Sport and it really crushed all beef baby yeah 100 kosher beef right there that's all that is everybody I look good though right I think this should have been I was good at football but this should have been a sign I didn't have a future in it because everybody else on the team everybody else when they took their football pictures they would they'd be like yeah a very serious Stone series dead serious and then like I went down and like kneeled down and I was like hey [Laughter] what could have been it's that time it's time for the news and officials in New York City were prepared today for a possible indictment of Donald Trump and any resulting protests with 36 000 uniformed police officers standing by in Manhattan tell you what I bet Trump's ready to defund the police now 6 000 cops cops 36 000 in uniform now this might sound extreme but it's standard practice for any former presidents who are about to be arrested for paying hush money to porn stars that's ugly always been the way the NYPD is preparing for the worst meanwhile Melania is sat at Mar-A-Lago like please don't put him under house arrest please don't put him under house anything but house arrest tell you what I'll tell you what I consider house arrests to be the absolute dream scenario the dream scenario isn't it oh I'd love to but I I'm under house arrest Dude tell me who I have to manslaughter because I foreign s are on a retreat in Orlando this week to discuss policy and talk up their agenda but they're frustrated because so far they're mostly getting pulled away to discuss Trump yeah not fun is it having to having to constantly talk about Donald Trump welcome to my life for the last six years Republicans are annoyed that they have to focus on inconsequential things like their former president being charged with crimes when what they want to do is focus on serious important issues like drag queens reading in libraries conducted by two Harvard professors over a 25-year time period found the the marriage could help women live longer being married leads to a healthier lifestyle more optimism and a greater sense of purpose you can just see husbands at home everywhere now like me sitting here on this couch is the healthiest thing that ever happened to you babe this helps win live longer Crazy longer happier lives unless of course that marriage falls into the very small percentage that end in an episode of Dateline then it's according to the study marriage increases lifespan even if you end up getting divorced so like a lot of people in La if you get remarried like four or five times you're practically Immortal have you noticed a healthier approach to your life since getting married oh yeah absolutely yeah I mean night and day it's night and days for you yeah yeah I was on a collision course your main in your main eating hours were between midnight and three yeah yeah I got all six thousand calories in my day in that three-hour Square by the way this is a tangent and I'm doing I'm on medication right now so if any of this is weird I apologize I have an ear infection I went to The Cheesecake Factory the other day yeah and they put the cat I know it's California state law but they put the calorie count on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory stop it yeah [Applause] stop that yeah it's called The Cheesecake Factory what did you think what did we think we were getting there no one's sitting down and going oh let's just grab a bite and then going oh we should leave there are items so there are like combinations of food that you can get at the Cheesecake Factory with an amount of calories is is four digits it's oh yeah yeah easy easy four digits more calories than I made in money a year before I started working here yeah the I don't need to know I don't need to be a scientists in New Jersey had to spend their whole lives making the chemicals for this to taste like a chicken fajita so let me like give them a break leave me alone I agree I like it I like this thought and finally Dodge just unveiled the last gas-powered muscle car that they will ever release before their factories are all converted to make electric vehicles it's a 2023 Dodge Challenger that they're calling the last of the rumbling cars I love how Dodge is all sentimental about it like hey babe let's pollute the air one last time together what do you say Dodge is converting entirely to Electric it's having an impact everywhere actually I just saw this ad for a new summer blockbuster that's coming out the quiet and the responsible and then [Applause] [Music]",

be here now be present breathe [Applause] you know next time you got a long flight like that yeah you could watch all four Rockets it's that same it's time for over the weekend Donald Trump made the shocking announcement that he expects to be arrested on Tuesday you know it's bad when a former president announces that he's going to be arrested and the general response is for which crime this is related to the New York grand jury investigating Trump's hush money payments to Stormy Daniels so if you're keeping track that's two times Stormy Daniels has screwed Donald Trump New York City New York City New York City is already bracing for unrest after Trump urged his supporters to quote protest take our nation back of course Trump urged his followers to protest in New York like what else is he going to urge them to do he'd be like oh go and see Ben Platt in parade it just opened a magnificent reviews on Broadway I'll tell you what when I saw this story Dave ABS Dave absolutely loved

just pulled Tuesday out of thin air the grand jury hasn't even voted to indict with more testimony given before the grand jury today I like that even Trump's going I don't need to wait until this is over to know that I'm [Applause] I'm guilty man I'm guilty as Sin got to be something bigger going on here it's Tuesday melania's birthday is that what it is I actually think I actually think this whole plot of him going I'm going to get arrested on Tuesday once they don't arrest him on Tuesday he can then go see they haven't got enough evidence according to a new study so-called dad jokes help kids develop into healthy adults the study suggests that when fathers embarrass their children with unfunny jokes it teaches kids how to overcome awkwardness it also gives every child something to talk about in therapy that's what it is Dad's telling bad jokes helps turn kids into healthy adults meanwhile dad's playing saxophone around the house helps turn kids into whatever this is I don't know by the way why do melons have weddings because they counterlope there you go just me doing my part to make America a better place for the future you are gonna be wait when you become a father you are going to be the absolute king of dad jokes oh yeah I can't wait I'm already brushing up two muffins sitting in an oven one muffin turns to the other and says hot enough for you and the other muffin says oh my God a talking muffin foreign [Music] [Applause] study Americans spent nearly 14 billion dollars last year while shopping drunk I hope this only refers to online shopping no one should be black out drunk in the middle of a Home Depot you know hey look here's what I'm going to say sometimes drunk me likes to get sober me a little gift okay and when a giant slip and slide shows up along with 10 Super Soakers I'm like wow he gets me I mean I will say online shopping is way better than the things we used to do when we drank too much like in our 20s it was like oh God oh God I got smashed I texted my ex last night and now we're like oh God I blacked out and I ordered a milk frother from Amazon you know Steve can you tell us about your drunk uh Amazon orders oh I bet you've got a cavalcade strapping I don't know if this is gonna make it to TV but I dated a woman that was half my age oh God and she was very kinky and uh we used to drink wine and smoke a lot of dope and be online on sex toy stores and and just she'd be like I want that I want that I want that I want that I was making some money so and so I ordered everything but I was blackout and then for the next week UPS guys would like full-on you know dollies with boxes for showing up to my apartment building and bringing my little thing and I had just it was like I could start my own porn business with it like we were getting everything man like boxes and boxes were showing up all week and I'm like yeah that's my Amazon it's not a story that's for you I swear to God I'm gonna there's gonna be a lot of things I'm gonna think about finished this show regrets things we didn't oh I didn't get to do that we didn't get to do that and I feel like the one that will hang over all of them is that is that we we barely even scratched the surface of what a kinky bastard Steve is and if you hear about this the scientific Community got very excited recently over a photo that they saw of a rare goblin shark the goblin shark was photographed for the very first time in the Mediterranean Sea they were incredibly excited until it turned out that the shark was just a plastic toy scientists first became suspicious when the fish started singing Don't Worry Be Happy skeptic cited numerous reasons that they think that it's a fake shark including the shape of the jaw the incorrect number of gills and the fact it says made in China on the fins and finally we wanted to show you this during the morning weather report on St Patrick's Day an interaction went viral after the meteorologist remarked that she was holding a remote control in each hand which led her to say this Thursday partly sunny skies and 57. and to another woman who likes to be double-fisted in a different way foreign [Applause] [Music]

Stars and you said that you got so inspired you might want to compete on Dancing With the Stars is that true can you dance I would love to learn how to dance yeah and you know the show's amazing right and so it's just incredible the way they transform into these prolific dances and you know I was a hot mess you know I used to fly home from here Friday night get there Saturday afternoon straight to L street watch the live show and then jump back on a Sunday but uh I would love to do it before I get too old just so I can move properly without any hip replacement on the first dance I'd love to see you I really really would it's just the tanning and the sequences and the Lycra and oh sure yeah seemed like you got a real problem with the tanning yeah and also I've got size 15 feet that is true yeah they're a big boats yes what about you could we ever see you on on Dancing With the Stars have you ever do it yeah you never know how bad my career will get [Applause] uh anything for sure um uh a good dancer per se but I am good at weddings I'm like oh really yes I'm a fun wedding guest has to see that in you yeah but I mean I have like a certain Rhythm on the floor it's kind of like um someone who like uh just took a nitrous balloon at a dead show kind of got a nice Groove yeah I'm good in a horror uh and I feel like I drink enough that I like no one else is gonna be embarrassed yeah yeah you're right you create space for other people I give everyone their room to grow yeah yeah I do think that should be the first episode of Dancing With the Stars it should be no Partners No it should just be people dancing on their own yes for three minutes it is hard sometimes when you're at a wedding and you're like I had a few drinks you're like I do want to dance like do you remember yeah you're like okay yeah we're gonna walk down the aisle one day there's gonna be the first dance and there's gonna be the parents dance so I just want to do it properly yeah yeah I just you think you'd do like one of those super choreographed like I would work my ass off to get that thing absolutely now I swear it's gotta be like a Saturday Night Fever all in white and I'll just wait I would let rip the idea of this oh yes now Adam I don't I think it's going to be a while until you are in a in a position career-wise where you have to start considering uh Dancing with the Stars because you've just shot this new show I'm very excited for this with Arnold Schwarzenegger now how was it being with him did you get alone time we do you think this is the start of a lifelong friendship um no [Applause] I don't think we'll be well maybe we'll be friends but uh I think that he he thought he thought I was amusing right to him he's like he like you know when when you like go over to a friend's house and they have like a cat that chases a laser and and you watch it for a second you're like all right that's cool what are we doing today like I was the cat with a laser to arm right I mean he was like oh all right that's here today what's going on right but but we definitely um like I would I would try to break the ice with him by trying to speak his language and so I hit the gym sometimes you know I I I would be like you know asking specific questions like when you do an Arnold press which they named after you is it like this range of motion he would instantly start laughing right and I would be like why are you laughing at me you know I want to know this information he'd be like come on why do you care [Laughter] now I got a congratulate you on your brilliant newest show next level Chef it's such a clever idea it's so I love this whole idea for a for a cooking competition for anyone who doesn't know tell us all about it so it's three Kitchens on top of her you've got this amazing sort of uh Top Flight amazing three Michelin star top kitchen middle is like a banqueting kitchen and then underneath that you've got this basement is this sort of dingy dirty kitchen with dilapidated in sort of equipment and nothing working and dull lights and just yeah zero in there and the chefs have to move their way this platform descends you've got 30 seconds to grab ingredients then you cook your way to the top and to get to that next level status so yeah super super cool it's so good and the people on the bottom level what I love is that they they're left with kind of the worst food but actually it's kind of amazing they managed to make these gourmet meals like if you are such a such an acclaimed Chef if you had ten dollars uh to spend on you could only go to a 7-Eleven right what would you make from that that's hard yeah but what would it be we're not going to spend that money um so I would go for like the instant Mash powdered mash and take you know rehydrate it turn it into something delicious like a gnocchi nice get some chopped steak do like a Philly chopped steak fried eggs from 7-Eleven yeah and then get like a sports drink reduce it down and do like a gas streak so it'd be like a sort of Philly steak fresh knocking from the pound the Gatorade reduction yes yeah wow like a gastric is I don't no no no no um like the farm no no no no no no it's not a gastric band a gastric is like it's like this sort of vinegary delicious acidic reduction right beautiful I'll get that in a 9.99 wow what about you Adam you got 10 bucks in a 7-Eleven

chocolate oh Jeremy well on that note it's that time it's time for the news [Applause] to Jets shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday I know this is very very serious I know it's a serious situation but you have to admit the fact that it's a balloon [Applause] it does make it feel quite silly doesn't it on the bright side from now on when it's your your kid's birthday balloon pops and they're upset you can just go no it was a Chinese spy balloon to me the Chinese can't spawn us anymore you're a Patriots China says the American government has overreacted I'm sorry but if you wanted everyone to smile about this at least send us balloons in funny shapes of course right here in Los Angeles the Grammys were held last night did everybody watch absolutely brilliant show as always things kicked off with some incredible looks on the red carpet lizzo wore this spectacular floral cape lizzo Red Riding Hood [Music] the outfit's amazing it you know like camouflage you'd use if you needed to sneak into Elton John's house unnoticed here's what Harry Styles wore on the carpet look at that [Applause] can look good in that if you saw me walking down the road wearing that you'd think I'd just failed out of clown School now if you look carefully you'll see he only exposed half of each nipple and that's how you can tell it's a formal occasion did everyone say did you see Shania Twain here she is in a black and white polka dot suit with a matching oversized hat I gotta tell you I saw that I was like yeah that actually does impress me much I love it look at it she looks like Beetlejuice on mushrooms the big look of the night last night was sparkly silver outfits Beyonce lizzo first lady Jill Biden and Harry Styles all took their lead from the fashion icon that is the Cybermen from Doctor Who now all of that silver was actually specially designed to reflect any Radars on Chinese balloons jealous Chris Martin he looked so comfortable I was like honestly I was like as I saw him I saw him and I looked at what I was wearing and I sort of when I was at home I got dressed I was at home I looked in the mirror and I was like yeah you know what I mean you know when you look and you're like oh yeah I look pretty Chic then I got there and I was actually around like cool people who are Chic and realized that I was dressed like a geography teacher simmer down simmer down simmer down I will not open this envelope until everyone has calmed down then I saw Chris Martin he looked so coming he looked he looks like he looks very excited to spend the quarter that the tooth fairy's just left him Chris Martin looks like he's trying to pretend he's not upset that I just told him I don't have a minute to discuss Greenpeace could you uh could you pull off any of those outfits if you were going to Grandma's what would you wear ah no I look like I coach Middle School football I can't I can't wear cool outfits no no I if I wore any of those silver ones I'd look like a baked potato there's just no Chris Martin no he's a rock star so you can dress like that he looks like he fell asleep at Staples Center and then was interrupted by the

I don't care how much traffic there was missing your Grammy win is an automatic one star deduction for that Uber driver you know it is as someone who lives in La I did feel for her traffic on the 405 is actually one of the only things that can break your soul is there a historic night Beyonce won four Grammys bringing her total number of wins to 32 making her the most decorated artist in Grammy history I think that's it now I may not say I honestly think this is this is the I think people are finally going to just start listening to Beyonce and giving her a chance you know Beyonce surpassed

but not real you know so don't jump into that Hornet's Nest do not do that I know I made that mistake about a decade ago I forget what I think it was on a TV show in Britain I forget and I said you know well it's not real and the reason I said that is if it was real you'd you'd be able to bet on it right it didn't go over well with the uh with the wrestling Community yeah do they still have tag teams are they still a thing they're still doing tag teams yeah it used to be The Bushwackers you remember them yeah the Heart Foundation there was hawk and animal yeah the Legion of Doom Macho Man Randy Savage Oh yeah yeah yeah there was there was doink and Dink and they were clowns never made it it's over across the water yeah doink and Dink never made it across the water yeah never made it across the bigger clown and a little clown never made it across the world and they got it never made it across the water what what would your wrestling character be have you thought about this oh that's this is this is a good one yeah what would I call myself yeah what would be your whole theme Mr Cheese like cheese like smile for the camera or like you work at a deli Camp yeah and then the whole time people would be like do you have any cheese yeah that would be my that would be my thing and I when I pin and he goes one two three I stand up and go do you have any chance reg what would you go for wrestling name uh oh the crab cake nice I love that oh we could that we would be a good team cheese cheese and crab cake yeah they're good yeah fondue what about you the dreidel the dreidel yeah spins you out spin me around spins you around those spins you around the ring yeah I love yeah the drainage Dr dreidel Dr Dre yeah [Music] it's that time it's it's time for the and this morning the FBI conducted another search of a Biden property looking for more classified documents this time it was his vacation beach house in Delaware the FBI didn't find any more documents but they did find one of Biden's flip-flops so he finally has a full set again I can't keep up with this so many FBI searches I don't know I can't keep I feel like we're talking about Yellowstone spin-offs it wasn't easy for those poor FBI agents they had to spend hours listening to President Biden going there's no documents here that I'm Delaware of it wasn't me I didn't say it I'm saying don't he was like oh that was bad I'm like no that was it doesn't matter and today President Biden and house Speaker Kevin McCarthy met face to face for the first time to discuss the looming debt ceiling crisis Biden was like nope McCarthy was like nope and they were like good first meeting let's go back in a week there was no Common Ground according to historians there hasn't been a meeting this tense between a Joe and a Kevin since the Jonas Brothers decided to go solo moving on did everybody see this Tom Brady released a video today announcing his retirement this time for good I'm retiring we're good I know the process uh was a pretty big deal last time so when I woke up this morning I figured I just pressed record and let you guys know first so I won't be long-winded I think you only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year making his announcement sometimes your grandparents timeshare [Music] what a career though you know what this means it's both me and Tommy two Elite athletes retiring this year in Peak physical condition at the end of the video by uh Brady got a little emotional sadly without football he's going to have to fill his days with nothing but being insanely Rich accomplished fit handsome and single now I'm stopping the show in April I'm going to like retire do you think I should do a Brady stop the show returns just immediately come back out of retirement in May I should do that [Applause] I I I love you I think it I think that you do great if you did that but I think I would urge you to look at how it went for Tom Brady when he did that and you know he didn't go to the playoffs he got hurt a couple times and he got a divorce and I think that I wouldn't maybe follow that path you know yeah and a school worker in Illinois has now been charged with stealing 1.5 million dollars worth of chicken wings after purchasing them with school funds the thief was considered armed and dangerous meanwhile the chickens were considered disarmed and Furious foreign like you ordered 1.5 million dollars worth of chicken wings you steal the 1.5 million dollars worth of chicken wings like what's the next move what do you do I just hope you run you right I have no concept of how many chicken wings you can get for 1.5 million dollars what would that even look like [Music] thank you [Music] okay and get ready to argue because according to a compilation of expert reviews one website has compiled an unofficial top five list of the best candy bars of all time Snickers takes the top spot followed by Twix Reese's Peanut Butter Cups take five and KitKat and this list has just made my top five list of most bullet lists this is an outrage these are all American candy bars you can't say the list is the best of all time and only put American foods on them this is like having an American baseball championship and calling it The World Series Super Bowl and declaring yourself the world's what's your top five top five of all time candy bars go number one Butterfinger yeah yeah we got some people that's the most engaged you've ever been in the show ever go on number one Butterfinger number two take five it was on their list chocolate it's one of America's best candy bars number three I gotta go Reese's Peanut Butter Cups all right yeah a little non-traditional but it's a peanut butter cup it's fun number four Twix it's all in the mix they're fun to eat it's a little bit of a party a little chocolate it's a little chewy Little Mix it around yeah you can mix it around you do a bite and then you do it you know you pull it away yeah you can just do the caramel go around the sides it's a party for everyone several different ways to eat it and number five might be a little controversial but I like a Hershey's cookies oh cream cookies and cream stuff Hershey's itself garbage Hershey's cookies and cream why are you only All American candies you've been to the island of the of the greatest chocolate ever do fruit snacks count because like I'll throw a Percy Pig in there I think we're just on chocolate here I think we're just on chocolate my problem with British candy bars is I can't remember any of the names like you could make up 20 of them and 19 could be real and the one I would never be able to pick it up uh reg what's your top five I do like I do like Snickers yeah I have to say that you know I've got no problem with this knickers I've got no beef with it it's fine uh peanut M M's correct I I like it's just you to me that's a universal that one kind of universally just works everywhere but um except for the people they're like ah anaphylaxis but uh but uh if we're going into British territory oh man what's the uh the galaxy galaxy [Applause] well you know a Dairy Milk a Dairy Milk which is really a Cadbury's dairy milk yeah and then you've got a whole nut you know you got a whisper yeah double decker right there's a whole world oh your candy bars sound like nicknames for the funny kid in class oh I'm sorry we're not as good as Butterfinger and finally according to a new study 85 percent of senior citizens now play video games at least once a week many of these grandparent games say they first picked up the console during the covid-19 lockdown and now use them regularly to keep their mind active I love this I love I love I love some fresh meat to destroy in FIFA in the same study 36 of elderly people say they play video games every day this has also led to an increased demand in retirement communities for flaming hot Cheetos and Mountain Dew in fact it's so popular companies are now making games aimed especially at seniors there's Red Dead hypertension Super Mario mobility scooter of course Grand Theft Auto you left your blinkers on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

it has yeah hasn't been a while since you've you've sort of dropped something into our inbox yeah okay [Music] I'm going to ask you this now no and I want you to know I'm being deadly serious is everything okay yeah for the most part okay so you've just sort of given up on that little fun Trope you know I think perhaps Thursday there may be something Nick call the network now that that information is out there Thursday is going to be a ratings gangbuster I don't know okay should we try it again it's time for the news foreign Administration has announced that they will end the covid Health Emergency on May 11th to which most of the country was like oh yeah that's right covid yeah the timing makes sense might as well squeeze in one more spring break Public Health Emergency For Old Times Sake you know the administration plans to end the public health emergency in May I know that's why I'm stepping down at the end of April you know what this means we did it guys let it be known the lately show ended covid foreign moving on it came out today that the FBI searched Joe Biden's former Think Tank office back in mid-november despite the administration repeatedly saying that it has been transparent about classified documents and searches this one wasn't disclosed until now if you ask me the White House has been very transparent you know they are willing to admit to anything as soon as it comes out laughs this happened to Biden's Think Tank you know where he Ponders the weighty questions of the world like how do they get the entire model ship inside that little bottle The Raid happened in November now in Biden's defense that time around Thanksgiving and Christmas it's always nuts we all lose track of time it would be really easy to forget about the FBI searching your think tank in other political news Donald Trump is now suing journalist Bob Woodward for almost 50 million dollars Trump says that he never agreed to allow his taped interviews with Woodward to be sold as an audio book Trump must wake up every morning have a stretch and just think who should I sue today he's also suing Simon and Schuster and his parent company Paramount Global which I should tell you is also the parent company of CBS meaning that they own this show so listen up you come for Paramount you're coming for me buddy okay not just me you're coming for young Sheldon old Sheldon the middle Sheldon every Sheldon you don't want the smoke I want it and this morning Congressman George Santos has been facing calls to resign after lying about his background told Republican colleagues in a closed-door meeting that he will recuse himself from serving on house committees mainly because he's going to be too busy performing with lizzo and Bad Bunny at the Grammys Santos made the announcement to colleagues during a closed door meeting here's my question why do they bother closing the door if they're just going to come out and tell us what happened this is a closed door meeting and then they come and go you're never going to believe 78 of Voters in his district want Santos to resign from other from Office the other 22 percent just love to watch a messy what do you think he's going to do I think he's I think he naturally he's going to be on the male singer isn't he yeah for sure and even if he isn't he'll tell people that that's him yeah do you think you'll do the masking I feel like that's the next that oh Dancing with the Stars I think he's more Dancing with the Stars guy you think he's a bigger bigger dancing yeah a lot more Face Time more dancing right better outfits yeah well he choreographed that new Elvis movie so exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah and a six-year-old boy in Michigan is making headlines apparently his dad let him use his phone to play a game but the boy ended up opening his father's GrubHub app and ordered a thousand dollars worth of food according to his father the doorbell just kept ringing and cars just kept coming this is true among other items the kid ordered a thousand dollars worth of jumbo shrimp salads shawarma chicken Pita sandwiches ice cream and chili cheese fries there's no denying it this kid is going to have the best Super Bowl party on the Block everybody when he told his dad what happened his dad was like oh GrubHub thank God I thought it was something else it's brilliant really it's pretty like order a big screen TV and his parents could just return it order a trip to Disney World they could cancel it you order a thousand dollars with worth of food you're gonna end up eating a thousand dollars worth of food I actually think this kid is smart now because if you ordered all of that food from one place the restaurant might become suspicious might call if you spread it out over multiple locations you know what I mean that's what I learned when I found out when I found there Josh Groban's credit card in the couch over there what if you think about this kid is he a criminal or a mastermind Mastermind or a criminal mastermind quick criminal mastermind on CBS now I he's a genius he's a hero I wish I feel like the future's in good hands I used to worry that China would overtake us but as long as we got kids like this we're gonna be okay have you ever had that have you ever done that thing where you order you you order like a delivery to your house and you've ordered the food just for you and then you look in the bag and they've put in like eight sets of utensils and you're like ah yeah am I right they they heard this order and thought well that sounds like it's for eight people I did not I did ninety dollars at Taco Bell once because wow couldn't you have bought a Taco Bell I was in like West L.A at our like with some friends and then we got an Uber we got we had a lot to drink got in the Uber headed back to my house in like Far East L.A and I like ordered some Taco Bell Postmates on the way but I was too drunk to remember to pick like the Taco Bell close to my house so I ordered from a Taco Bell that was like in Santa Monica and then they delivered 25 miles to the East and then it showed up and we housed it and then woke up the next morning and there was one burrito left with a bite in the middle well you know what this means somebody somebody at that party was a psychopath yeah somebody I I saw something just this weekend that I have never seen in my life before and it made me look at my daughter she's eight years old my daughter Kerry I looked at her suddenly and thought you are gonna do something different because it's what she did on Saturday afternoon was she uh opened a Twix right and she said two sticks and she straight up just she just bit into the two fingers of the Twix like it was a Snickers and then looked at me as if to go yeah I think different I said I said Carrie Carrie I've never seen anybody it tweaks that way she said why wouldn't you eat a Twix that way and I was like [Music] we got to get her on climate change well

wondering if the anteater has two heads have a look now the craziest part is it's not just any second head it's a tiny Panda's head look at that look now people on Twitter were really confused which is nice because usually they're just you know outraged uh it turns out this is actually normal all giant anteaters have Furry Paws on one of their legs right that's what it is the heads here and they have a furry paw here and it really confused the internet which apparently doesn't have access to the internet and that's the news they'll be right back everybody [Music]",

time if you want to talk about like the movies he's been in do you think yeah I mean it's very poor though huh it's very poor that's why he's doing this he's proud I've never told you the story of I told the story about when I met Harrison Ford I told you the story the first time I went to New York I was in this play called The History Boys and uh we went on a world tour and everyone kept saying to us on the world tour uh well you're gonna love it on Broadway because all these big famous people come to see the show and everyone comes backstage to meet you afterwards we're like this is going to be great we open on Broadway we had extraordinary nights now we had one night in that show we're in the same row was David Bowie James Taylor and Steven Spielberg in the same row no one came

like this all day but we have no time because we have to give you the news [Applause] that's happened the United States reached its debt ceiling today which will now Force the treasury Department to take quote Extraordinary Measures to keep the country from defaulting on its loans you know it's not a good situation when the treasury Department is like hey man can you can you can you wait until next week to cash that check by moving money around the treasury says they can delay a catastrophic default by up to five months catastrophic default catastrophic device it either sounds like it's very bad or it's something Tony Hawk did to win the X Games in 98. who's Donald Trump now look I don't I didn't like the guy I don't like the guy I don't you've got to admit he is pretty good at not paying money that he owes in other news there were massive strikes and protests across France today as workers pushed back on the government's decision to raise the legal retirement age from 62 to 64. people in France haven't protested like this since they raised the legal smoking age to seven the current retirement age is T2 that's amazing when you're 62 years old in America you've still got another 18 years until you can become the president of the United States the French people though they are very upset they are they're very upset they're like work so French people don't it I think I think that wanted to work that that captures it pre-rolls I mean not pre-rolled yeah rolling and rolled yeah it's a hand rolled that's a good detail this is [Laughter] moving on the Canadian government has called for a substantial reduction in alcohol consumption releasing new guidelines and saying no amount of alcohol is healthy welcome to dry forever I'm not taking Health advice from Canada a country that's over french fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds what what even kind of advice is this none is healthiest no yeah yeah they're like people are like say to me not go and go the right way so this is I'm drinking a I'm drinking a let's say I'm drinking a gin and Sonic okay hey you know uh alcohol it's it's best to drink none of that I already regret it it's bad [Applause] squeege squeege squeegee squeegee [Applause] foreign actually very satisfying Canadian officials say no amount of alcohol is healthy meanwhile British officials recommend you limit yourself to no more than 15 pints in one afternoon and did you hear about this the rapper Flo Rida won a massive lawsuit against the energy drink company Celsius the jury determined that the company breached the terms of his endorsement deal and now need to pay Flowrider 82 million dollars [Music] in dollars from Celsius to translate that for the rest of the world that's 179 million in Fahrenheit apparently Celsius tried to sell out of court but Flo Rida was like that number's too low low low low low thank you [Applause] um do you think we're a place now where we've got too many energy drinks that's a person I know has like an anxiety problem where they're like yeah I'm gonna see if my doctor will put me on Xanax and then they'll open like a Monster energy drink the size of it yeah like a great size of a baby yeah like it sounds like that when they open it I have panic attacks I don't know why you can't even see me those people are like drinking a coffee like one of those big Starbucks that likes 6 p.m they're like I just can't get to sleep and have you seen this viral video a California couple was testing out their dog's new crates um and then for some reason reason they both decided uh to at the end get into the crates at the same time so look they climb into the crates okay so he's gone in and then they only they don't realize that the doors have locked behind them [Music] so then he scoots his rounds so he can open the door and reach over and unlock the crates yeah it's a weird couple [Applause] after seeing this their dogs immediately put themselves up for adoption and finally with Valentine's Day coming up brox has just released new conversation heart candies based on the TV show Friends with phrases like how you doing pivot and on a break yeah very timely this timely I guess it took them 20 years to come up with all the clever sayings like latte foreign you know I think they should come out with conversation hearts with actual conversations that couples have you know Hearts to say things like we need to talk and why didn't you take out the trash and finally I wasn't staring at the waitress and that's the news we'll be right back everybody [Music] [Applause]

at him I wasn't mad at it I wasn't mad at it yeah I noticed the first thing I saw and I thought wow a camel based Rubble yeah and then it occurred to me that you cannot over enthusiastically clap if you are wearing a camel jacket yeah because a re immediately it gives you an heir of someone that goes not in a bad way but it was like we're happy you're here but you should also be very happy that we're right and I am [Music] it's about time it's time for the news and this afternoon the President Biden hosted the Golden State Warriors at the White House to celebrate the team's 2022 NBA championship they gave Biden a jersey with his name on it and this is nice in return Biden gave each player a top secret document now on two other occasions the Warriors refused A White House visit because uh Trump was in office that's when you know that's when you know that you are a dominant teen you win two championships you're like now we're just gonna we'll wait and win another one when there's another guy there this is true Biden welcome to Warriors today right after meeting with Dutch prime minister Mark Rooter I'm just picturing Biden going up to some staffer and being like yeah how about a little two on two I'll take Steph Curry you take Dutch prime minister Mark Walter and the White House has announced that President Biden will visit California later this week to tour areas devastated by extreme weather while he's there he's also going to check in on Prince Harry's frostbitten penis [Applause] decent name for like a band you know what frostbitten penis print here is for us bit and penis Prince Harry's frostbitten penis you're not Prince Harry a little bit right have you ever seen us for us but in penis no have you seen his regular penis I'm not I can honestly say I've not seen one member of the royal families member I haven't seen no I have not I have not no not at all you know it's amazing if it doesn't look any different but does it change drastically [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will say I will say that got the exact look it deserved from our camel wearing throttle over there it was just this all three of them went I haven't I I if you listen to it Have you listened to it the bit on his book where Prince Harry's book where he's talking about is what does he call it a todger do you do anyone hear any Americans ever refer to their penis is a todger yeah nothing never [Applause] never yeah told you now we we'll say like like or Willie I mean I had such high hopes for this show I did I did every day every day I walked down I stand behind the curtain I genuinely I promise you I stood there tonight I thought I thought we've only got like 49 of these to go you gotta soak up every second of this James you've got to soak it all up let's really let's really go out there and be let's be the show you want it to be and within he doesn't know what day of the week it is 45 seconds we are discussing UK and U.S names for penises can you speak with us I love this one are we even allowed to say these on on TV nickel will they be beeped do you have to beepish long or you can say that's a really good question I feel like that one might that one might pass I think we'd get away with long you get away with but no interesting when we go off on these tangents is I have to come back to the story let's see how that plays out you know Biden loves these trips [Applause] to be clear the stories about Biden visiting it doesn't matter it's mainly coming here to make everyone feel better about the weather by telling them about worst storms from the past it's like you think this is bad I remember the winter storms of 52 and let me tell you it was wetter than an otter's pocket foreign pocket obviously a different euphemism did you see this after 30 years on the run it's Italy's most Wanted mafia boss has been arrested in Sicily I didn't even know until this point the being a mob boss was illegal in Italy I just thought it was a completely viable career option like dentist or Vespa salesman he was reportedly detained in a private medical clinic the doctor was like we're going to take your blood pressure so go ahead just put this cuff on your arm and then put this cuff around your wrist and we've got him we've got it here he is after the arrest he's being charged with racketeering extortion and worst of all impersonating the Ikea monkey and in a major breakthrough scientists have for the very first time successfully demonstrated a way to prevent dangerous lightning strikes by actually steering them away using lasers they did so by firing lasers at thunderclouds from the top of a Swiss mountain I feel like this is something like my son when he's hyped up on sugar would try to write a story about he'd be like people control lightning with lasers from a mountain it could help in stopping lightning strikes it's all a bit technical scientists said the key is finding the perfect storm cloud aiming the laser beam just right and then making sure that you make that pew pew make that sound when you shoot the laser here's an interesting study according to researchers being in a bad mood can actually make you better at work apparently when people are in a negative mood they're more careful and analytical this is why Winnie is such a valued member of the team thank you imagine that if you're in a bathroom you get home and your spouse is like how was work honey you're like it was fine I had a really productive day people are in a negative mood to do better at work do you think this is true I don't know if this is true I I don't know I've I've never been angry at work foreign do you think this is true though that people are in a bad I don't think this is true if this was true it would take like 20 seconds to renew your driver's license at the DMV thanks for that laugh babe audible laugh from Pete it's number three on show 1150. who in the band gets in the worst moods me really yeah I don't think I've seen you in a bad mood okay you've seen you don't see it it's just there you know like it's it gets done you can feel it okay you've seen him break a guitar on his birthday and that was in a good mood yeah you never crossed me if someone was in a bag it's working then yeah it is the facade works we wanted to tell you about this a woman in Mexico is being hailed online as a genius because she got a tattoo on her arm which actually launches her Spotify playlist so that she can request music from a DJ have a look [Music] I love it it's amazing incredible the woman is being hailed online as a genius and by her parents at home as an utter disappointment she's only a genius I think if her playlist is just track after track of Mambo Number Five but now in the song at the club all you have can you scan my arm I'm saying can you scan my arm we need your camera with your camera give me a phone you've got to update your Spotify app it's not hard to know what forget it don't worry about it and that that's the news we'll be back everybody [Music]",

setting up a Lifestyle brand yes like thank you madam the other side of this what would we call it what would it be we should call it droop and we only sell erectile dysfunction that's right Brian could work is there in doing a doing like famous men Brad Pitt has a skincare he's got a skincare line yeah has he yeah is it just called be Brad Pitt and that's yeah I do think that is a big part of Brad Pitt's skin being good yeah is that it's on Brad Pitt's face if if Paul Giamatti had a skincare line I'd sign up for that because I'm like okay he's doing something you know what I mean correct yeah also I will say this Paul Giamatti phenomenal skin great skin but I take Paul giamatti's skin over Brad Pitt's Brad Pitt's face okay to put that skin on you'd like to drape Paul giamatti's skin over a Brad Pitt's sort of facial structure and that that's a Lifestyle brand it's that time it's time for the news the news and this uh what was that the news and this afternoon President Biden traveled to Mexico City for a summit with his fellow North American leaders Mexican president obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau the meeting is traditionally known as The Three Amigos Summit first item on the agenda was coming up with a cooler nickname for this Summit it's called The Three Amigos Summit because you just know Joe Biden is going to use the word Amigo at least three times every minute the leaders are going to discuss border security immigration and trade policy you know like Amigos moving on at last there is a new Speaker of the House Republican Kevin McCarthy won the job in a dramatic 15th vote early on Saturday morning after a contentious four days and 14 failed balance this is what happens when you try to put someone named Kevin into a position of power things got a little crazy as voting continued continue Friday night Republican Mike Rogers confronted Matt gates after he refused to vote for McCarthy and had to be restrained by another lawmaker Republicans resorting to violence on the house floor what a perfect way to honor the two-year anniversary of January 6. you just know the Bravo executives Bravo Executives were looking at this like guys I think we might have a new franchise meanwhile Democrats had nothing to do but wait while the Republican majority figured things out here's California representative Katie Porter on Friday reading a book on the house floor titled the subtle art of not giving up I kind of love it I do love it because nothing says subtle like a bright orange book with a matching shirt and in an effort to sway votes to McCarthy at one point represent Marjorie Taylor green actually tried to pass her phone to a fellow Republican with what appeared to be Donald Trump's initials on the screen yeah yeah that's how you calm down a chaotic situation get Donald Trump involved the caller ID the caller ID on the phone just says DT and everyone's like she's calling Trump we don't know that's Trump we don't know she could easily just be calling Danny Trejo we're gonna need some coffee and donuts we're gonna be here in a while moving on did you see this yesterday right wing supporters of Brazil's former president ransacked the presidential Palace Congress and Supreme Court leaving a trail of Destruction in their wake hmm I wonder where they got that idea from 12 00 protesters were arrested and swiftly removed it was a full Brazilian over there gone in one dramatic motion and the big story today Prince Harry has been making the rounds giving interviews to promote his new book spare which comes out tomorrow

[ Cheers and applause ]\nGreat photo. -This is my brother.\nWe both played. I mean, I played for like -- I mean, some of it is I played\nDivision III for a year. And, you know, because of the Internet, it\nlooks like I was a total jock, but I really --\n-That counts.

I didn't want to bother you\nwhile you were doing it, but were you excited?\nWere you -- -Oh, my gosh, it was so amazing. It's like you're invited to,\nlike, graduate school at Harvard,\nyou know? -Yeah.\n-Participating on \"SNL.\" And then they pull\nin all these MVPs. And so I was just --\nI was kind of blown away. But it was amazing. And it was so fun\nto play Governor Walz, because, I mean,\nI grew up in the Midwest, so I just did an impression\nof my brother Mitch, so... [ Laughter ]\n-Perfect. -Who's a sweet guy who is\nsentimental and a sincere guy. So I just did that. And when I went in for makeup,\nthey were like, \"You're good,\" you know?\n-Wow. -It was perfect.\n-That never happens. Yeah. The last time\nwe hung out together, hopefully you remember this. I will never forget this.\nWe met the Pope. -Yes. The Pope. Unbelievable.\nThe Pope invited comedians... -To the Vatican.\n-...to the Vatican.

It's almost like all the people that couldn't behave\nin church or synagogue... [ Laughter ] ...or a mosque had to see\nthe principal. -Yes.\n-And it was so amazing. It was like 6:00 in the morning. And the Pope did say, you know, that humor is really important,\nwhich was beautiful. And I think --\nI don't know about you, but like, I'm kind of like,\n\"Yeah, that's really nice to hear, but I just do it because\nI like attention, you know?\" -Yeah, yeah.\n[ Laughter ] -But it was pretty special,\nright? And as a Catholic kid --\nYou grew up Catholic, right? -Yeah. Of course.\n-It's a huge thing. And you do feel like,\nas a Catholic or even a lapsed Catholic, you're jumping the line because\nthere are such sincere Catholics that know what's going on. Like, to this day, I'm in church and I've been going for,\nI don't know, 58 years. And I'm like,\n\"Oh, now we stand up?\" [ Laughter ]\nI still don't know. -I still don't know the rules. I don't know the rules.\nI guess we're all kneeling. I guess we're kneeling.\n-Alright, we're doing this now? -We're doing this. Yeah. -You know, so, but it's amazing. -It was always great.\nIt was great to see you. And I kept looking over at you,\nand I'm like, \"Is this real?\" -Yeah.\nNo, there's something wrong. -Yes. There's something wrong.\nIt was great. And how's the family doing?\n-Good. Good. Good. You know, I'm still recovering\nfrom Christmas break. You know,\nI travel with -- My wife and I, we travel with our kids,\nand it's -- It's always kind of a disaster. You know what I mean?\n-Yeah. -I don't know what\nthe thinking is. It's kind of like, \"Hey,\nyou know, we bicker and argue. Why don't we take this\non the road?\" You know?\n[ Laughter ] How would you like to not listen\nto me in a hotel room? You know?\n[ Laughter ] Maybe you should spend\ntoo much time on your phone in a different state. -Yeah. -But my kids love it.\nThey have a blast. They're on vacation. I'm not sure what they're\non vacation from. Uh, can you really be\non vacation from eighth grade? I don't know, you know. It's like my son goes\nfrom barely doing homework to doing absolutely nothing. -Yeah, it's a vacation.\nYeah, but you're busy, man. You're on tour now.\nYou're going back out. You have a solo tour, but also you're going back out\nwith Jerry Seinfeld. -Jerry Seinfeld.\nI'm trying to help Jerry. -Jerry. He needs --\n[ Cheers and applause ] -Poor guy.\n-He needs ticket sales. -It is so fun touring\nwith Jerry because obviously he is\nkind of like a comedy Aristotle. And by the way,\nyou had Letterman here, which is -- it's just\nthese legends. It's unbelievable.\n-Yeah. -And Jerry is, uh...\n[ Applause ] Jerry's somebody -- you know, it's fun touring because\neveryone has their own rituals. And Jerry, every morning on tour\nyou have breakfast and then you go see a movie,\nand then you go to lunch, and then you go for a walk. And that's more than I do in\nlike a week. -Yeah. A lot of work.\n[ Laughter ] -He does all this stuff\nand it's so fascinating just hanging out, and you know, as a comedian, just like when\nyou go on do shows with Nate, some of it\nis fun doing the shows, but it's fun hanging out\nwith other comedians. -And just talking.\n-Yeah. -Yeah, and just --\nYeah, go and see the movie too. I remember going to see\nthe daytime movies because comedians have nothing\nto do during the day. -Yes. And you --\nwhen you're coming up and, you know,\nyou're just a bunch of losers. You just hang around each other.\n-Yeah. -And so\nwhen you get some success, they bring you, you know. Your success brings you away\nfrom your friends. So it's always so special\nwhen you can hang out. -And your tour, your solo tour,\nEverything Is Wonderful. -Yes.\n-Is the name of the tour. Are you excited to go back out?\n-I'm so excited. I'm doing some shows\nin Kentucky and Tennessee for the sole purpose of\nacquiring bourbon in Tennessee. -Yes.\n[ Cheers and applause ] By the way, your bourbon\nis unbelievable. -Oh, thank you so much. -You brought some last time\nyou were on the show. It's not a joke. It's not like just\nsome celebrity name, Jim Gaffigan's Father Time?\nWhat is it? -Father Time. Yeah.\n-Father Time. It's fantastic, buddy! -Oh, thank you.\n-Thank you very much. -I've gotten so into bourbon, and bourbon is\na uniquely American spirit. It really -- I mean, and when I\nsay spirit, I don't mean, like, rah-rah spirit or whoo spirit,\nI mean glug-glug spirit. -Okay. Yeah, yeah, of course.\n[ Laughter ] -But after you glug-glug,\nyou might be rah-rah or whoo! So it all kind of works\ntogether.\n-Yeah. -But I, you know,\nit's so fun doing these shows. And since I've gotten into it,\nyou know, Kentucky and Tennessee\nand North Carolina, Texas, it's just -- there's\namazing distilleries out there and people have to go\nand buy your local bourbon. You got to check it out. There's some great stuff\nout there. -Support the bourbons\nout there. Yeah. Why not? Let's talk about\nyour very funny special. It's called \"The Skinny.\" In part, it's\nbecause you talk in the special how you lost a lot of weight.\n-Well, you know, I mean, I think it's such\nan interesting thing to say I lost it because I, you know,\nI'm on an appetite suppressant, so I didn't have anything\nto do with it. [ Laughter ]\nI shouldn't get any credit. It's a little bit like when, like, we compliment\nsupermodels for being beautiful. It's like they were\njust born that way, right? And so I love the fact\nthat I've lost weight, but it's, you know, essentially, this drug has made me\neat like a human, you know, whereas before I would eat\nlike a dog. You know?\n[ Laughter ] -Really?\n-You know, like, if you give a dog --\nif you leave the dog food out, the dog will eat\nthe entire bag of food. And that's like me, you know? -Yeah, well, it's doing\na great job, but I want to show a clip\nof your stand-up. It's very good. Here's Jim Gaffigan\nin \"The Skinny.\" Take a look at this. -Parenting teenagers\nhas made me a better comedian. No, that's not it. [ Laughter ] A bitter comedian.\n[ Laughter ] I know that sounds negative, but it is almost sad when\na kid becomes a teenager, right? Because you have this cute\n12-year-old and then boom, they become Satan.\n[ Laughter ] You can literally witness\nthe curiosity and wonder transform into body odor\nand poor judgment. [ Laughter ] And then you, the parent, you're supposed to learn\nhow to communicate with them! My wife e-mails me articles\n\"how to talk to your teenager.\" I'm like, \"Delete.\" [ Laughter and applause ] -Jim Gaffigan, everybody. \"The Skinny\" is streaming now\non Hulu. More \"Tonight Show\"\nafter the break. Stick around.",

I think you'll like this one.\"\nAnd I go, \"Okay.\" Then you're like,\n\"I'm changing this.\" There's no one\nI can think of that writes their own music,\nperforms their own thing. You'll hum something\nand you're like, \"No.\" And then you'll go over to the\nkeyboard and start playing it. Then you'll play\nthe bass guitar. Then you start harmonizing\nwith yourself. And then I'm like --\nthen you get out -- Then you pick a director\nfor your single. -It's not at the same time.\n-No, it isn't. Then you dance.\nNo one else dances.

I'm sorry. -Is it odd?\nIs it odd that -- Yeah. It's because\npeople are listening. But, yeah, we have had\nthis conversation, but -- -No, so, but I'll tell it.\n-Thank you. -Okay.\n-And we want to know. -Yeah, so, four years\nand different from making albums before, because I would just go in\nfor a block of time and say, \"This is what we made,\nand this is what it is.\" And during the pandemic,\nyou know, having our second son, which was unbelievable -- -Oh, shout-out to --\n-Thank you. -Shout-out to Phin.\nWe love you, bud.

Because -- -We ended up with like\nalmost 100 songs. -Seriously. I remember --\nI've heard probably -- -That's not an exaggeration. I'm not saying that\nbecause it's a nice number to say on television. We ended up with\nalmost 100 songs. -But you cut it down.\n-Narrowed it down to 18 songs. -Wow.\nSee, if I ever wrote 100 songs, I would release all 100 songs.

Yeah, Biden knows\nSpielberg's work well. Anytime his staff\nbrings his poll numbers, he hears the theme from \"Jaws.\" Of course,\nbecause it's Hollywood. Biden won't admit his approval\nrating is shrinking. He just says\nit's on Ozempic. Speaking of Biden,\nearlier today, he announced\nthe largest investment in passenger rail transportation\nsince the creation of Amtrak. The largest investment\nsince the creation of Amtrak, which is big for Biden\nbecause he was there for the creation of the wheel. Yeah, Biden just announced\na massive new rail investment, and we actually got\nour hands on the message Biden recorded that\nthey're playing on every train in the country\nstarting today. Yeah. Check this out. -I think that's fantastic. What? Come on.\n-Pocket full of salamanders? -Yeah. Pocket full\nof salamanders. That's right. Well, people are talking\nabout this.

      "page_content": "-Welcome, everybody. Welcome, welcome,\nwelcome to \"The Tonight Show.\" You're here. You made it.\nThank you for watching. [ Cheers and applause ] Guys, it is the holiday season, and today, it even started\nsnowing here in New York. [ Cheers and applause ] Yeah, it was just a few flakes, but LaGuardia\nshut down immediately. Well, here's some fun\nlocal news. You guys aren't\ngoing to believe this. A guy in Brooklyn\njust won $10 million from a scratch-off ticket\nfor the second year in a row. Yeah, he's loving life today. He marched into his old job\nlike, \"I quit again!\" Well, guys, everyone is\ntalking about this. Last night in Alabama,\nfour candidates took the stage for another Republican\npresidential debate. Yep. The big winners from\nthe night were Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, and everyone who decided\nnot to watch. Yeah, last night was\nthe fourth Republican debate. At this point, it's kind of\nlike \"Indiana Jones\" movies. Three was enough.\nYou know what I'm saying? Once again, the debate\nwas kind of crazy. People are saying it was\npretty controversial when Vivek Ramaswamy\nheld up a sign that said \"Nikki=corrupt.\" -Ooh! -I don't think that that's\ncontroversial. I mean, I think it would be\nreally controversial if he held up a sign\nthat said... I mean, because that's --\nPeople are -- That is not --\nA hot dog is a hot dog. Meanwhile, Chris Christie\ncame out swinging and went after Ramaswamy\nand he really didn't hold back. Watch this. For real. -You do this at every debate.\n-I'll say exactly -- -No, don't interrupt me.\nI didn't interrupt you. This is the fourth debate,\nthe fourth debate that you would be voted,\nin the first 20 minutes, as the most obnoxious\nblowhard in America. So shut up for a --\n[ Cheers and applause ] -Wow. Wow! It is clear Ramaswamy\nisn't well-liked. After he attacked Christie, the moderators were like,\n\"Governor Christie, you have two hours to respond.\" At another point\nduring the debate, Chris Christie said\nthe other candidates were afraid to mention Trump\nand treat him like Voldemort, he who must not be named. And that got me thinking. There's actually\na lot of similarities between Republicans\nand Harry Potter. -Oh, boy. Here we go. -What's up, Tariq?\n-Well, let me guess. You're going to show,\nlike, a bunch of side-by-side photos of Republicans\nand then the Harry Potter -- like, the characters\nthat they look like. -Yeah, that was the plan. -Well, I know exactly\nhow this will go. So, first, you'll show\na picture of Harry Potter, and then you'll say he looks\nlike House Speaker Mike Johnson. And then, after that,\nyou'll show a picture of -- I don't know --\nprobably Draco Malfoy, and you'll say he looks\nlike Eric Trump. And then, finally, after that,\nyou'll show a picture of -- I don't know -- like,\nNeville Longbottom when he got frozen,\nand then, boom, there he is, Mitch McConnell. Is that how this is going to go? -I mean, yeah, yeah,\nthat was pretty good, but you're a little off. Yeah. Because, first,\nI'd show Harry Potter, but then I'd say he looks\nlike George Santos. Then, after that,\nI'd show Draco's dad, Lucius Malfoy,\nand say he looks like Marjorie Taylor Greene. And, finally, I'd show\nfrozen Neville Longbottom, but he's more like Ron DeSantis\ntrying to stand normally. -I got to give it to you, man.\n-Yeah? [ Cheers and applause ] That's right, everybody. The debate lasted two hours,\nand a lot happened, so it was honestly hard\nto keep up. Thankfully, we have a remix\nto help you out. Check it out. -Let's get started.\n[ Hip-hop music playing ] -Nikki is corrupt. -It's not worth my time\nto respond. -That's not true. -Don't interrupt me.\nI didn't interrupt you. -I have a woman problem. -The most obnoxious\nblowhard in America. -Walk yourself off that stage,\nenjoy a nice meal. -Don't interrupt me.\nI didn't interrupt you. -They all had man dresses on. -Get the hell out of this race. -Don't interrupt me.\nI didn't interrupt you. -Thanks for watching.\nThank you, guys. -There you go.\nJust a little remix. [ Cheers and applause ] -Well, switching gears, guys,\nthis is very sweet. Apparently,\nevery year for Christmas, President Biden\ngives his wife, Jill, a personal poem\nthat he's written. -Aww!\n-Isn't that cute? Yeah, and this year,\nhe's been writing a bunch, trying to find\nthe right one to give. And we actually got a hold\nof the wastebasket from the Oval Office\nthat has some of the rejects. Should I read\nsome of them right now? -I would, yeah.\n-This is the official waste... -Wow!\n-...of the Oval Office. James, can I get some\npoem-reading music, please? [ Soft music plays ] Oh, that's perfect. Sweet, right? This one here.\nHow about this one? Oh! -He really crumpled them up.\n-This says... -Aww!\n-Isn't that sweet? -That's cute.\n-It's cute. He did crumble them up.\nHe did crumble them all up. Yeah.\n-Really hard. -Yeah. Well, he probably\nshoots them in the basket. -Yeah, probably did that\nfrom a long distance. So, I mean, that's... -Oh, there's another one.\n-Yeah. -He wrote a lot of these.\n-Yeah. Oh, this is nice. Well, it's close. He's cl--\n-He's close. -He means well. This is the last one here.\n-Wow, that one looks glued. There you go. That's fantastic.\nIsn't that nice? That's cute. Merry Christmas, everybody.\n[ Cheers and applause ] We got the wastebasket.\n-Wow. That's so great you got that.\n-Yeah. You guys see this? A new poll found that\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams' approval rating is at 28%, which is the lowest\nin that poll's history. Yeah, he's pretty unpopular. Check out this news thing\nI saw, local news. -Mayor Eric Adams' approval\nrating is now at a record low, according to a recent poll. To put that in perspective,\nhe's now less popular than... and even... -Oh, my God!\nThat was in the local news. [ Cheers and applause ] Hey... -Hey! -Switching gears, I read that,\non a recent flight from Canada, an off-duty pilot had to step in after the captain suffered\nan uncontrollable nosebleed. Yeah. This is why\nbefore I board a plane, I always double-check that\nthe pilot's not a third grader. [ Laughter ] And this made things worse. Instead of tilting his head back\nto stop the bleeding, he tilted the plane. -Oh.\n-Yeah, it was... Guys, finally, we have\nexactly 12 shows left before we go on Christmas break,\nwhich means it's time for that beloved \"Tonight Show\"\ntradition. It's time for\n\"12 Days of Christmas Sweaters\"! -♪ \"12 Days of\nChristmas Sweaters\" ♪ ♪ 12 days left ♪ -That's right. Every show between\nnow and Christmas, we will be giving\none lucky audience member a spectacular Christmas sweater from the Countdown\nto Christmas Cabinet. Since there are 12 shows left,\nlet's open door number 12. [ Drumroll ] Whoa! [ Cheers and applause ]\n♪♪ Wow. This is gorgeous.\nLook at this. I don't know what that is.\nHoly moly. Alright, now let's see who's going home with\ntonight's sweater. Everyone look\nat your seat number, okay? If I call your number,\nI need you to jump up and let me know where you are. Quest, can I get\na drumroll, please? [ Drumroll ] Who wants me\nto pick their number? It's a good sweater. [ Cheers and applause ] 442! [ Cheers and applause ]\n♪♪ Hi! How you doing?\n-Good. How are you? -I'm fantastic. What is your name\nand where are you from? -Maria from Colombia.\n-Maria from Colombia! Oh, my goodness. Maria, you have\na beautiful sweater on. Does it get\na little chilly in Colombia? -Um, no.\n-No. So this is perfect,\nbecause those rare occasions when it does become chilly,\nyou're going to have something. Do you have anything like this?\n-No. -No. Would you like to\ntry it on? -Of course.\n-Oh, my God. Guys, give it up for\nMaria from Colombia. [ Cheers and applause ] You got your gla-- Oh. -Thank you.\n-No pr-- Oh, Maria, this is --\nI mean, this is gor-- Look at this. That's gorgeous. Oh, you're a model.\nThank you so much.

My mom -- They were\ngoing to name me Catherine, but my older sister's\nJacqueline, and they thought that might be too confusing\nfor babies to figure out. -Yeah. Catherine and Jacqueline.\nYeah. -Yeah. And, so, yeah,\nmy mom loved the way it sounded on \"Friends\"\nfor Jennifer Aniston, and then that was my name. -I mean, that's a perfect\nperson to be named -- We love -- Who doesn't love\nJennifer Aniston or Rachel? -I love Jennifer. -You could have been\nnamed after the hairstyle. -I could have been Ross.\n-You could have been Ross. -Who knows?\n-You could have been Ross.

And she said --\n-Whoo! -Thank you. And she said to my older sister,\nJacqueline, who I took to the show\nwith me -- She was like, \"Jacqueline, if they play 'Getaway Car'\nor 'Maroon,' she's on crisis watch.\" Not only did she play\n\"Getaway Car,\" she also played \"Maroon.\" I was having a mental breakdown\nin the audience at MetLife Stadium. -I love it. -Yeah.\nAnd then Ice Spice came out.

Which you did live on set.\n-I did, yeah. -You can do it.\nYou know how to do it. I mean, I was reading somewhere, there was, like, inspirations\nof Dolly Parton in there. -Yeah, yeah. Well, it's -- She's a very --\nShe's a country, folksy singer. And, so, Suzanne Collins,\nwho wrote the book -- she used to be\na country-music deejay. So she had this, like --\n-Oh! -Yeah. And it's like\nshe has such a deep knowledge\nof that whole world, which I really didn't know\ntoo much about. -I didn't know\nshe was a country deejay. -I didn't either.\n-That's fascinating. -Yeah. And so she's obsessed\nwith Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, and then we kind of\nbased her voice off of that. -How cool.\n-Yeah. -Well, the soundtrack --\nit comes out this Friday, as well, with you\nare featured on it. -Yeah. -And Olivia Rodrigo\nis featured on the album. -Yeah. So everyone's\ntalking about this. -Yeah. -It's already got over\na million streams already. It's just crushing.\nCongratulations. -Thank you. -And you accidentally\nstarted a rumor, and I thought tonight\nwould be the perfect night for you to clear up this rumor. -It's time to address it.\nOh, my goodness. Yeah, I accidentally\nstarted a rumor that Nicki Minaj\nwas on the album for \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad\nof Songbirds and Snakes.\" -That is not true.\n-It's not true. She's not. She's releasing her album\non Friday, I believe. But it was one of those things where there's a character\nnamed Barb Azure in the movie. And the actress who plays\nBarb Azure has a great sense of humor. Her name is Honor Gillies.\nShe's so fantastic. And posted a video\nof Nicki Minaj saying, \"Calling all Barbs\"\nwhen she got cast. And her character plays\nthe stand-up bass in the movie. So, obviously, I commented,\n\"Slapping that super bass,\" as you would. -Yeah.\n-Now, the Barbs got me good. They were screen-shotting\nthose comments, posting them\nall over social media, being like,\n\"What is mother doing? They are very, very, very\ndedicated and amazing. I am a Barb.\nI love Nicki. -Yeah.\n-But she's not on the album. But she started playing into it. She posted a TikTok\nwith \"The Hanging Tree\" song, saying like, \"I have something\ncoming out November 17th.\" Like, she knew what\nshe was doing. I had no idea what I was doing.\n-No idea what she was doing. No, no. You were just being you\nand you go, \"I didn't know. I'd even start this rumor.\" -And I didn't know if she\nwas on the soundtrack, so I was just\nkind of like, \"Okay.\" -And she's not.\n-And she's not. -Okay, good.\nI'm glad you said it. -Just me.\n-Yeah. No, good. I'm glad. It's you and Olivia Rodrigo.\n-Yeah. -We're happy.\n-Yeah. -Okay, yeah, we're good.\n-Thanks. -Do we set -- How do we set up\nthe movie \"Hunger Games\"? This is pre-Katniss.\n-Set 64 years in the past. It's been 10 years\nsince the districts and The Capitol\nhave, like, gone to war.

      "page_content": "-Thank you, thank you,\nthank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.\nEnjoy yourself, everybody. Welcome, welcome,\nwelcome to \"The Tonight Show.\" You're here. You made it.\n[ Cheers and applause ] Thank you for watching at home. Well, guys, last night\nhere on NBC was the third Republican\npresidential debate, and it's being described\nas \"unhinged.\" [ Laughter ] Oh, yeah. There was name-calling,\nwild rants, and personal attacks. Even Trump was watching\nlike, \"Game recognizes game.\" [ Laughter ] \"Game recognize game!\" [ Laughter ] Yeah, it was vicious.\nAt one point, Lester Holt was like,\n\"We interrupt this debate with a 'Real Housewives' reunion\nalready in progress.\" [ Laughter ] It was quite a night.\nDuring the two-hour debate, Nikki Haley got\nthe most questions, Tim Scott spoke the longest, and Ron DeSantis spoke\nthe [coughs] shortest. [ Laughter ] Yeah, one of the big moments\nfrom the night was when Vivek Ramaswamy went\nafter Nikki Haley's daughter for being on TikTok.\nWatch this. -I want to laugh\nat why Nikki Haley didn't answer your question, which is about looking\nat families in the eye. In the last debate,\nshe made fun of me for actually joining TikTok\nwhile her own daughter was actually using the app\nfor a long time. So you might want to take care\nof your family first. -Leave my daughter out\nof your voice. -Adult daughter. The next generation\nof Americans are using it. Here's the truth.\n-You're just scum. -The easy answer... [ Audience \"Oohs\" ]\n-Ooh. -Then the moderator tried\nto calm things down, and he was like,\n\"Nikki, Vivek, remember, none of you\nare going to be president.\" [ Laughter ] \"Just want to --\nJust calm it down.\" [ Cheers and applause ]\n\"Calm down.\" Not only did the attack\nbackfire for Vivek, it also went viral on TikTok. [ Laughter ] And get this.\nFor a while now, Tim Scott has claimed\nto have a girlfriend, but no one has ever seen her, and donors have been worried\nit's hurting him in the race. So, after the debate,\nhe brought her up on stage. Yeah. When asked how they met,\nshe was like, \"I was his Uber driver\non the way over here.\" [ Laughter ] Smart move by Tim Scott. He's probably not\ngonna be president, but at least people know\nthat he has a fake girlfriend. So that's good.\n[ Laughter ] \"She lives in Canada.\nYou guys don't know her.\" [ Laughter ] \"She doesn't go to school here.\" [ Laughter ] Meanwhile, former president\nTrump didn't attend the debate and said held his own rally\njust a few miles away. It was the first time\na Trump rally was the less chaotic\nRepublican event. During the rally,\nTrump said Republicans should stop wasting time\non debates. Then he said, \"And let's also\nstop wasting time on elections and just declare me\nthe winner, okay? Come on.\"\n[ Laughter ] Switching gears, you guys,\nhere's some great news. After 118 days,\nthe Screen Actors Guild reached a deal with\nthe Hollywood studios. The strike is over! [ Cheers and applause ] -So, tune in tomorrow\nwhen my guests will be everyone. [ Laughter ] Uh, yes, interesting that the -- [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ Oh, my gosh.\nWhoa. The guys from\nPlease Don't Destroy. Oh, my gosh.\n[ Cheers and applause ] Welcome.\nWhat are you guys doing here? Shouldn't you be up at \"SNL\"? -Dude, I'll tell you\nwhat we're doing here. -What?\n-We were on the show three days ago,\nand we couldn't talk about our movie\n'cause of the actors strike. -Yeah, but now it's over,\nand we can talk about it. So why don't you book us? -What do you mean,\nwhy don't we book you? You were just here. -Yeah, but we weren't able\nto talk about our movie. \"Please Don't Destroy:\nThe Treasure of Foggy Mountain,\" coming out on Peacock.\n-Yeah, well... [ Cheers and applause ] Well, you come back,\nand you can talk about it. -Who do you have booked tonight?\n-We're fully booked. We have Jared Leto\non the show tonight. [ Cheers and applause ] -Well, what movie\ndoes he have coming out? -He's not talking\nabout a movie. He's announcing a world tour\nwith Thirty Seconds to Mars. -So he's not talking about \"Please Don't Destroy:\nThe Treasure of Foggy Mountain,\" coming out\nNovember 17th on Peacock? -No, he's not talking about it. -Oh, okay.\n-Okay. Who else is on the show? -AJR is on the show tonight. [ Cheers and applause ] -Oh. So AJR is going to talk about \"Please Don't Destroy:\nThe Treasure of Foggy Mountain,\" coming out on peacock.com November 17th?\nYou can sign up today. -Uh, no, AJR is not going to\ntalk about that at all. They're a great band,\nand they have a new album coming out tonight --\nat midnight, actually. Tonight. Yeah.\n-Wow. So then... [ Cheers and applause ] I mean, I just don't understand how the hell anyone\nis going to find out about \"Please Don't Destroy:\nThe Treasure of Foggy Mountain,\" which is coming out, uh,\nNovember 17th on Peacock. [ Laughter ] -Yeah, I don't know\nhow that's going to happen. I'm sorry.\nI'm sorry to let you down. -Okay. Alright. We're gonna\ngo do \"Seth.\" Um... -Wow.\n-Before -- Before we leave,\nwe just want to say this audience is\nthe best audience in the world! -Get out of here! -Love you, Jimmy. -Bye, guys. Get out of here! [ Cheers and applause ] Get out of here!\nPlease Don't Destroy! Please Don't Destroy. No one's gonna talk\nabout it. The strike is... [ Laughs ] That's just so funny. Guys, anyway, as I was saying,\nthe strike is finally over. That's right. When the actors\nheard a deal had been reached, they gasped, screamed,\nlaughed, cried, and then were like,\n\"I also do accents.\" [ Laughter ] Seriously, the actors are back\njust in time. I'm not sure the world\ncould handle another reality dating show.\nAm I right? [ Laughter, audience groans ] Speaking of --\n[ Laughter ] Like, you recognize\nmaybe two of those. Come on.\n[ Laughter ] Speaking of, tonight was the\n\"Women Tell All\" episode of \"The Golden Bachelor.\" -Ooh.\n[ Audience \"Oohs\" ] -Yeah.\n'Cause who doesn't love hearing their grandma\ndescribe sex? [ Laughter ] -Oy!\n-\"You pulled the muscle in the fantasy suite? I pulled a muscle\nin the fantasy suite.\" [ Laughter ] You guys see this?\nStarting next month, Disney+ and Hulu are going\nto be merged into the same app. -Ooh.\n-Yep, streamers are merging. Pretty soon, they're\ngonna be all in one giant app called cable. [ Laughter ] What are we doing?\nWhat are we doing? [ Applause ] What have we done?\n-Come on. -Yep. Disney+ and Hulu\nare merging into one app. That's good.\nNow, when your kid tries to turn on \"Bluey,\" he'll wind\nup bingeing \"Sons of Anarchy.\" [ Laughter ] Hey, it's good to see you, bud. I feel like we haven't\ncaught up in a while. -Oh, wow.\nI'm good. Thanks for checking in, buddy. -[ Chuckles ]\nWhat have you been up to lately? -Not much.\nWell, I was in Grand Rapids the other day.\n-Oh. How was that? Good. Had a little trouble\ngetting an Uber, but I figured it out. -In Grand Rapids\nover the weekend, an Amazon truck was stolen\nand then taken on a joy ride. [ Laughter ] -What else have\nyou been up to? -You know, lots of travel. Check out this small town\ncalled McKees Rocks. Just watch cars go by.\nIt was great. -Police in McKees Rocks\narrested a man they say was trying to expose himself\nto passing drivers. [ Laughter ] -Sounds like you've been busy.\nAnything else? -Let me think.\nUm... Oh, I went to my house\nin Connecticut, just west of Hartford.\nDid some gardening -- Oh. So relaxing.\n-In Burlington, Connecticut, west of Hartford,\na man is now charged with running\nan illegal psychedelic mushroom growing operation\nout of a house. [ Laughter and applause ] -Wow. You've had a lot\non your plate. -Yeah. Also, I went down\nto my winter place. The Villages in Florida.\nYou know me. Work hard, play hard. -A man who lives\nin The Villages was arrested by the feds, accused of having thousands of\ndollars worth of illegal pills used to treat\nerectile dysfunction. [ Laughter ] -Well, it was nice\ncatching up with you. -Hang on.\nI'm on the phone with my doctor. Yeah, well, it's been way\nlonger than four hours. -All right, Steve Higgins,\neverybody. Steve. [ Applause ] Guys, I heard about\ntwo women in Michigan who are accused\nof embezzling $20,000 from a Girl Scout troop. -Oh.\n-$20,000. That's almost the amount\nyour co-worker guilts you into buying each year.\n[ Laughter ] Apparently, one of the women\naccused was like, \"She did it. I was just a tagalong.\" [ Laughter ] -Come on! ♪♪ -Guys, listen to this.\nA U.S.-bound flight from London had to turn around\nafter crew members realized that the plane\nwas missing two windows.

Thank you\nso much for coming back. -Thank you for having me. -The first time\nyou were here, I want to say, it was three\nand a half years ago or something like that,\nand we were talking. We're both excited because\nyou had 32 million followers and on TikTok, and it was like,\n\"Wow, that's awesome.\" Here we are. That's not that long ago,\nthree and a half years ago, you're at 151 million followers. [ Cheers and applause ] Is that crazy? -I mean, to me,\nit's like, I can -- Like, this is a lot of people,\nand I get so nervous. So to think that I actually post for that many people\nis absolutely insane. -Yeah. -I can't really\nunderstand it, but I feel like\nit's better that way, because I can be less nervous. -Yeah. Well, how old are you\nwhen you first started? -I was 15.\n-15. -On the show last time,\nI was 15. -Good for you, buddy.\nThat's so tough. I mean, you stayed strong. I mean, that must be\na lot of pressure, you know, to start a business\nand keep going and and keep thinking of new ideas. And then you have the show, and now your whole family\nis involved now. Do you ever go back\nand watch your old TikToks? -I do and I make fun\nof myself a lot because it is so embarrassing. But it's also fun\nto go down memory lane and be like, \"Oh, my goodness,\nthis outfit was atrocious, but, look, it was so cute. I was a baby.\" -Yeah, yeah. You still are.\nYou still are. I wanted to ask you something,\nbecause I saw \"Vanity Fair.\" They did a thing.\nYou did a lie-detector test. You know what I'm about to say?\n-Mm-hmm. -Yeah, you love Dunkin' Donuts.\n-I do. -Okay, well, let's just watch\nthis lie-detector test. -Do you actually like Dunkin'\nas much as you say you do? -Yes, and I shamelessly\npromote them so much. No, I'm such a fan\nof Dunkin' Donuts. -I'm happy that they're doing,\nlike, cool stuff, though. -Do you think you like Dunkin'\nmore than this person? -Yes. -Do you know who that is?\n-No. [ Laughter ] [ Cheers and applause ] -You don't know\nwho Ben Affleck is? -No, I do,\nand I've, like, fully had conversations with him before. And, like, I know who --\nThat's why it's so unb-- My sister clowned me\nfor that so hard the entire ride back. I was so embarrassed.\n-But that's hilarious. So like, \"Yeah, I love --\" \"You like it better\nthan this person?\" And you just blanked? -Because I just, like --\nI know how much -- I've had two coffees\nalready today, you know? Like, I --\n-Yes. You were in the zone\nof Dunkin' Donuts. -I know how much I love it,\nand it's more than... -Anyone.\n-...anyone. -Yeah, including that person who, at the time,\nyou didn't know. -Now I've looked\nat the photos, I feel like we can be equal. -Oh, my God. That's so funny. You were telling me\nbackstage, though, that you actually had a great\nmeeting with Jennifer Lopez... -Yeah. -...who is like --\nGosh, we have that in common. She is unbelievable.\nWe both love Jennifer Lopez. -I love her.\nShe was the absolute sweetest. Every single time\nI've spoken to her, she, like,\ncan see inside my brain and tell me exactly\nwhat I need to hear without even knowing. Like, genuinely,\nmy dream when I was younger was to be\na backup dancer for her. That was all that\nI ever wanted in life. -Me too.\n-I'm such a fan. We still can.\n-We still can, yeah. Jennifer, if you're watching,\nwe're in. Yeah. -If you need us.\n-She is just the best, right? She is a pro. When she comes on the show,\nI mean, she -- Her in concert. Go -- If she tours again --\nWell, she will. -But --\n-She's insane. -A professional.\nShe puts the work in, man. -It's incredible.\n-Yeah. I know Halloween is coming up, and you're a big fan\nof Halloween. Can you say what\nyou're dressing up as? No? -I have, like, a list,\nquite a long list, in my notes of --\nI work on it all year long, add to it every week, you know? But, so far, I only have\nlike one or two locked down. I want to do Boo\nfrom \"Monsters, Inc.\", because I have the bob,\nand I feel like it just kind of works, you know? -Okay. That's good. -But, I mean, my boyfriend\nand I were trying to do, like, cute couples costumes,\nbut we're so indecisive that we just, like,\ncan't actually get it together. -Yeah.\n-We have time. -You do have a little time.\nYeah. Yeah. You have like a --\nYeah, you have like a week. You don't really have time,\nto really be honest. Your career\nhas actually blown up. It's so cool to watch on TikTok. Now you turn it into\na business now. You have a shoe line. Talk about this.\nHow fun is that? -It's crazy. I mean,\nall I really know about shoes is the fact\nthat I wear them every day, so I don't know\nhow it actually works, but we have such an amazing team\nbehind us that can, you know --\nWe're in heels a lot. There's three girls\nin the family. We're all constantly, like,\nblisters, everything hurts. So it's been really fun to take\nmy favorite parts of shoes and my least favorite parts of\nshoes and work it all together and make them comfortable,\nstylish, cute, get to pick the colors,\nthe shapes, the silhouettes, the styles. So it's really fun.\n-I mean, you have everything. You have, like --\nYou have slides. You have sneakers.\nI'm like, it's so -- Actually,\nyou wore them in today. I was like, \"You should just\nwear them out with your dress. Why not?\" They're, like --\nThey're cute sneakers. But that's wild that you go,\n\"Yeah, I had this idea and I'm going to make it real.\" And you're making\nall this stuff a reality. -I know.

I mean, I live with my older\nsister and we work together, so we spend quite\na lot of time together. You know, sisters -- we argue,\nbut we love each other. -A lot of family bonding.\n-Yeah.

This is actually true.\nWe did the interview. -Yeah.\n-Global interview. We were talking about\n\"Hackney Diamonds,\" which is finally out\nthis Friday. And we get to dinner,\nand you're not there, and we go,\n\"Where's Ronnie and Sally?\" And your wife sent a picture. She goes,\n\"Yeah, Ronnie's taking a nap.\" And there's you taking a nap. -I had to in order to\nstay up all night with him. But, yeah,\nthat's a Rolling Stone blanket made of T-shirts\nthat otherwise would get lost. I think it was a great idea. -It's kind of a brilliant idea.\nThese are all Rolling Stones -- I go, \"Do you sleep\nwith your swag?\" And you were like, \"No.\nI get all these T-shirts and all this stuff and I go,\n'What to do with it?'\" So you made it into a quilt. -Yeah, well, it's, like,\nlamb's wool-lined T-shirts. And it's, like, so warm. -It's super comfy. I love it. Let's talk about the album.\nHere we go. It's been almost 20 years\nsince -- -It's the first time\nI seen one opened up. -Is that right?\n-...shrink wrap. Wow!\n-I'm honored! -Hey, everybody! Welcome to the album.\nI'm really honored. -How does it -- How does it feel to have a new\nRolling Stones album? -Well, I can say\nit's about time. -Yes. Of course. 20 years is just about\nthe right amount of time. -It feels so exciting because I'm excited about every track on it.\n-Yes. -Every track has got\na different thing to say and a different direction. -I mean, we can talk\nabout things now. We weren't even allowed\nto talk about everything. You do a great song\nwith Lady Gaga, \"Sweet Sounds of Heaven,\"\nthat is unbelievable. And Stevie Wonder.\n-Yes. -And Elton John and --\n-Yeah, but Stevie Wonder and Lady are on\n\"Sweet Sound of Heaven,\" which you may have already\nheard because the only ones -- only tracks\nto be released so far are \"Angry\"\nand \"Sweet Sound of Heaven.\" And I'm just blown away\nwith them. I mean, to be in the studio\nwith that genius Stevie Wonder. -Yes, but which one are you\nlooking forward to the audience hearing, like,\nthat aren't those two? Is it the --\n-\"Whole Wide World.\" -Yeah, that's a great --\n-It's a great up-tempo... ♪ Da da da da da da da da ♪ -Yes. Yeah. I love it. Yeah.\nYeah. Okay. Good. That's good. -You're gonna love that.\n-You're gonna love that one. -And for the other side\nof the coin, there's a country kind of\nflavored song called \"Dreamy Skies\" where I get to play\na little slide and mix things. It's very country.\n-I should mention, also, this was made after\nthe passing of Charlie Watts, who is obviously your brother\nand your band member, one of the greatest drummers. -Yeah, well, some things\nare beyond our control, and losing Charlie\nwas one of those things. But before he did pass,\nhe said to me and to the band -- Because I was the last one\nto see him in his hospital room. And he said, \"Just make sure that you get Steve Jordan\nto cover for me. And when I get well,\nI can come, you know.\" But he said, \"Until then, please make sure\nyou have Steve Jordan.\" And Steve is like a rocket ship\nbehind you. It's so fantastic. -And so you got Steve.\n-You know Steve. -Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.\nWe love Steve. That's wild. But you got to do two songs -- Charlie plays on two songs\non this album. -Yeah.\nAnd Andrew Watt, our producer, a magic producer.\n-Andrew Watt, by the way -- -Pulled this out of the hat.\n-What a great job he did. -Yeah, well, he did. He had some wonderful\nlittle ideas, like, \"Okay, let's use the drum track\nof Charlie on 'Live by the Sword,' and I'll call in Bill Wyman\nto get the bass.\" And so in Charlie's absence,\nwe got the band -- the original band back together. -Original Rolling Stones. Yeah. When you came\nonto the Rolling Stones, that was '75, '76? -Yeah. It was '74. My first solo\nalbum with \"Shirley.\" -Oh, yeah.\nYou do know the song! A-ha! Yeah, you're just\nplaying with me. Yeah. -In fact, it didn't sound\nanything like it. That's the funk version. -That's the fun part.\nThat's what makes it fun. But, so,\nyou come into the Stones. They're already\nthe Rolling Stones. Did you -- Were you a fan\nof the band? Did you -- -Yeah.\nEver since I was at college. -Yeah.\n-I used to race home to see them on this show called\n\"Ready Steady Go!\" and \"Thank Your Lucky Stars.\" All the English TV shows we had.

And then this album comes out\nand kind of -- Can we talk about this song? -\"Bite My Head Off.\"\n-\"Bite My Head Off.\" -That's wonderful. We just\nrehearsed that yesterday. We've been doing a little bit\nof rehearsing to see how these songs translate live,\nand they're really cooking. -Can you tell people who is\na special guest on that song? -Paul McCartney --\nhis big dream -- said...

You know\nhow to do it perfect. -I'm going to totally...\nYeah, I'm going to sit. -First of all,\nby the way, look at this vinyl. -I love it. Yeah.\nThis is one of the colors. We have so many\ndifferent colors. I'm obsessed with vinyl.\nIt's beautiful. -I have too much. But yeah, I didn't like\nseveral different colors. -You have vinyl when I did\nyour show when it was in Los Angeles.\n-Yes. -And you had a record player\nin your dressing room. -Yes, I have them everywhere.\n-Do you still have it with you? -Yes, I have them everywhere.\n-You're our neighbor now. You're right across the hall.\nI know, rough commute today. -Yeah. Welcome.\n-Yeah. I love it. But I forgot, I was telling\nyou backstage. Like I forget,\nlike, when my show ends and I'm going home,\nlike, your show is beginning. And so I'm running into people\nin the hallway and I'm like, \"This is -- I'm not this cool,\nbut I feel cool.\" [ Chuckles ] -Because, you know, everybody.\nYou're like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" -I know, you run into people,\nand I'm like, \"Oh, that's awesome.\" -Did you have a great\nfirst -- first week here? -I did, we -- Well, I will say\nmy very first day, um... [ Chuckles ] I -- Look, I was very tired,\nand we were working a lot, and I had -- I had gotten\na venti matcha iced tea latte and then I was just tired. I don't know what happened,\nbut I got on, it was F4,\nthe elevator, F4. -That was classic.\n-And I -- Yeah. It is a -- It is a --\nIt is one of the most iconic elevators\never isn't it? -Fallon 4.\n-That's so funny. -Yeah.\n-Um... And then I proceeded\nto not only drop my drink in the entire -- Like,\nI mean a full venti. And then it looked like art.\nIt looked like it went. It went, like, all over.\n-Oh, my gosh. -And then I knew\nthere were cameras. So I was like, I was like,\n\"Oh, my God, this is going to be seen\nmy first time here.\" Anyway, I have completely\ntrashed an elevator. That was my first -- you -- you now have a rock star\nin the building, so. -Oh, yeah.\nYeah. You trashed. -By the way... -Trashed the elevator\non my way in. -You really did. Look at this.\nOh, my gosh. -Yeah, no. And you...\n-You really did. -You're not even...\n-I've never seen that. -You're not even getting\nthe full spectrum. It went to the ceiling.\n-Did you throw it? Did you slam it down?\n-No! I was standing there and it\njust slipped out of my hands. And I was like,\n\"What the...?\" And it went --\nIt went everywhere. -Oh, my gosh.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -That's a great way to..\n-You're welcome \"30 Rock.\" Thank you for having me.\n-[ Chuckles ] -I'm sure I'll be -- I'll be asking you\nfor favors like \"Kelly. Please come over whenever.\"\n-Oh, my gosh. You know I love games.\n-Come sing a song. -Yeah I will sing.\nI will do anything. -Yeah.\n-Tap dance. Whatever. -Is there a song,\nby the way, that you've sang more than any other song\nbesides your own songs? -Um, probably Aretha maybe. I don't know. I've sang a lot --\nA lot of songs. But probably\n\"Never Loved a Man\" by Aretha Franklin.\n-Oh, really? Was that the song you would\nsing, like, when you were a kid like trying out\nand going to talent shows? -Oh, no. Like my very first --\nI did do stuff from Aretha, but my very first song, I ever,\nwhich was a bold song to pick. I would love to say\nI was brave and bold. I was just stupid.\nBut I picked \"Vision of Love.\" [ Chuckles ]\n-Oh, my gosh. -Yeah.\n-Mariah Carey. -I was feeling very good\nabout it and it went well. It went fine.\nBut like, I just -- Why would you pick that song\nas your first song to sing in front of people?\nI don't know. -Because you like,\nmaybe you like the pressure. -I just love the song. -Did you ever tell Mariah\nthat that was your song? -No. Oh, my God. So what -- [ Chuckles ]\nI did, I did talk to her because I was like, \"Oh, I\" --\nShe knows I adore her. Because I've run into her\nseveral times and she's probably got me\non some security list to, like,\nkeep me away, but... -Are you in The Lamb--\nAre you a lamb? Are you in The Lambily?\n-I'm a lamb. I love her.\nI love her, yes. But I --\n[ Inhales sharply ] I did something stupid.\nShe came on \"The Voice.\" And we were working together,\nand I just -- Sometimes I say everything\nthat's in my brain, and I shouldn't do that. But I was trying to say\nbecause she was like, \"Oh, yeah,\nlike you're writing, too.\" I was like, \"Oh, my God,\nI know all your songs.\" Like, I'm a huge fan of her. People don't realize\nshe wrote all of that. Like not just sang it,\nlike, she wrote everything. And she was like, \"Well,\nwe should write together.\" And then in my head,\nI was just like, \"Oh, yeah,\nI don't really write like. I can't be, like, that\nvulnerable, like, in a room. I usually just like,\nwrite on my own.\" And then I walked away and my,\nmy friends were like, \"Do you, do you realize\nyou just told Mariah Carey no?\" [ Laughter ] -Mariah Carey wants to write\na song with you, and you were like,\n\"That's not what it meant.\" -That's not what I meant.\nI meant I'm not the best. Writing for me does not\ncome out in that scenario. I'm usually alone. Anytime you see my name\non a song, I wrote it. Usually alone. Yeah,but you would love to write\na song with Mariah Carey? -I would love to write. I love you, Mariah Carey,\nand I will -- I will risk it for you.\n-Yeah. Yeah. But I just also\nsaw you recently. You made some headlines\nbecause you rewrote the lyrics to...\n-Oh, \"Piece by Piece.\" -\"Piece by Piece.\"\nYeah. I didn't realize. it was going to --\nYeah, I just -- Look, I was finding a hard time\nsinging it, like I was like, I don't know if I want\nto really sing that, you know? And I'm at a different place. And I was\na very different place, and I. -Is it hard for you for have\nthat happen in your personal life\nwhen you have the talk show? -Yeah. -You're the most open and\ntalking every day and you're like,\n\"Well, now I really actually have to talk about this\nbecause, -Yeah, I know.\n-...my private life. -No, totally. And I'm going\nto be real with you. Like, I -- Those were\nthe last two seasons specifically were very hard\nlike behind the scenes. I don't know\nif you've ever done this. I'm sure you have, because\nyou've done this for so long. But, you know, sometimes you\nsend your representative because it's like,\nI can't show up today. Like I just have to, like,\ngo through the motions and be a robot because I, if\nI didn't, I would break down. So this is -- I'm excited about\nseason five here in New York because it's so -- it's --\nI'm in such a great place. My little kids are\nin such a great place. I'm happy, I'm present\nin interviews I'm on. -Yes. [ Cheers and applause ] It's like, yeah.\nBecause I wasn't. -I love you, buddy. I'm here for you\nif you need anything. -Thank you.\n-But I was thinking about you. By the way,\ncongrats on the great reviews and success on \"Chemistry.\"\n-Thank you. I saw that you redid\nthose lyrics and I go, Oh, my gosh,\nthat must have been...\" -But now everybody\nwants me to record that one. [ Laughing ] So, I'm, like...\n-That version. -The new version\nof \"Piece by Piece.\" It's like the most requested.\n-When I read it, somebody wants to do,\nit's called the healing version. -Yeah, it's like a --\nBut you know what? It is very true. Because, you know, now that\nI rewrote it literally an hour before I went on stage\nin Vegas to like, sing it because I was like,\nI can't sing these lyrics, but I know people want me\nto sing the song. And so I changed it\nright before the show, and, you know, it kind of\nput perspective on me as well. It's like that was a lot\nof pressure to put on someone, you know, to pick up the pieces\nof something of your past. So it's kind of --\nIt was a lot of -- There was a lot going on\nfor me that day, but it ended up working out. -Do you get emotional\nwhen you...? -Do I get emotional\nanywhere all the time? [ Laughter ] Like, right now?\n-Hello, this is my venti. Hello!\n-Welcome to 30 rock! -I did not want a venti.\nI wanted a large. This is too much!\nNow no one drinks it. -I just, I don't know\nwhat happened. It slipped. It slipped.\nI don't know what happened. -Wow.\n-It was art. -I mean,\nyou're doing this. I go like, ooph.\nI think I would get, like, all kind of like, I don't know if I'd make it\nthrough the song. -I don't know, you just do. -You just do.\n-Yeah, you just do. But yeah,\nthe audience was really -- My audience is cool. And they were like, cheering me\non because they noticed, obviously, I started\nchanging them. They're very intimate shows. And so these are like fans\nthat have been with me for the ride and they notice and then they're all like\nscreaming, like I'm like, \"Rudy,\" you know, at the end\nof the movie, like making it. You made it!\n-Carrying on their shoulders, like, \"Yeah, Kelly!\" -She's making it.\n-She did it. -It's -- \"Chemistry\"\nis the name of the album. I love the title. Did you always know\nthat was going to be your title? -You know,\nat once I wrote that song. I kind of envisioned\nit as the title for it, just because it's definitely\na roller coaster. It's not just a divorce album,\nit's a relationship album. There's the good\nand the the bad and the hard. All of it is in there. So chemistry\ncan be good and bad. -Yeah. -As I've personally\nfound out as well. So yeah,\nI kind of knew that. -I love you have a couple\nof guest stars on this album. -Can you believe it?\nSheila E. is playing on -- That's right.\n-Sheila E. is my... -I love her. -She's been here\nand she can play. -And she's also\nsuch a quality human. Like she's so nice.\nI love her so much. And then I asked Steve Martin\nbecause I knew he played banjo and I referenced the movie\n\"It's Complicated,\" which is one\nof my favorite movies, and I've seen it\na billion times, and I love him so much. And I asked\nif he would play on it, and I totally thought he was\ngoing to say no, and he didn't. Yeah. So he's on my record.\n-Wait a minute. That's your -- -That's your --\nThat's your guest stars Sheila E. and Steve Martin. -Who am I? -Yeah I was like,\n\"I have made it.\" -Yeah I'm happy that the new\nseason \"Kelly Clarkson Show\" is back, It's on Monday. And I thank you\nfor being here. And you're going to perform\nfor us tonight I think it's actually... But before you're doing\na special performance tomorrow night. -Yes, I am, I'm actually.\nThis is awesome. I'm performing -- performing --\nAudacy's put together this We Can Survive concert. And a bunch of artists\nare coming together for such a great cause,\nand actually, I have a ticket for everybody\nin the audience to come. [ Cheers and applause ] -I mean it's \"One Republic,\"\n\"Maroon 5.\" You guys all get tickets.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Giant concert,\nAudacy, We Can Survive concert. -Yes!\n-Kelly Clarkson, everybody. When we come back,\nKelly and I are playing\na fun new game. Stick around.\nCome on back.",

      "page_content": "-Thanks for coming on. I just saw your beautiful\nwife backstage. And today is the 20th\nanniversary of you guys meeting. -Yeah.\nThis is the day we met. 20 years ago.\n-Isn't that cool? -Yeah.\n-That's awesome, buddy. -Yeah, it's really weird,\nactually. And the movie \"Air\"\nis opening today, and we realize that\nMichael Jordan wore two numbers in his career, 45 and 23,\nand the date is 4-5-23. -Holy!\n-Isn't it crazy? -Yes. Come on. That's fun. -But much more importantly, it's 20 years\nsince I met Lucy, so... -Of course. Yeah. Yeah,\nthat's much more important. How is the fam?\nLast time we talked, you were moving everyone\nfrom L.A. to New York. -Right. Yeah, we did. We -- It was the smartest thing\nwe ever did, we're loving it. -You're here?\n-Yeah. We're in Brooklyn. -Yeah!\n-Very, very happy. Yeah, yeah. -You're loving it.\n-Loving it. Loving it. -Let's talk about\nthe new movie \"Air.\" I got to see it.\nAnd the reviews are in. Everyone loves it.\nIt is fantastic, buddy. You're so good in this. Everyone's good in it,\nby the way. -Everybody's great. I mean, we got just\na lights out cast. -You really do.\nBut everything was good. The script was tight.\nYou and Ben Affleck, obviously, everyone loves\nyou guys together. You're great.\nThis was 25 years ago. -Oh, yeah.\n-Look at this. When you won the Oscars\nfor \"Good Will Hunting.\" Look at how happy! \"Yeah!\" -We don't look too excited.\n-Yeah. I mean, you got to be -- I mean, what's going\nthrough your -- Remember this? Were you pumped?\n-I do. Well, we didn't -- The weird thing about that\nwas that we, like, the year before we were\nwatching it on TV, it was like -- we had no -- there was no adjustment period where we went, like,\nwe just suddenly were kind of there\nin the front row and Billy Crystal sang a song\nwith our names in it. We were like, What is happening? -What is going on with\nour lives? -Yeah. And we hadn't --\nwe hadn't talked about like a speech\nor anything like that because I think, as kind\nof lifelong Red Sox fans, we, you know, you don't\nwant to jinx anything. -Yeah, exactly.\n-Because I think both of us, without even talking about it,\nwe were like... because later\nwe talked about it and it was like I had this\nfeeling like if I ever said, Hey, we should think\nabout a speech, I would just flash forward\nto being like 50 years later\nin a bar with him going, \"Can you believe\nwe practiced a speech?\" -Yeah, yeah.\n\"That's why we lost.\" -\"Like we would ever win\nan Oscar,\" you know what I mean? And then suddenly\nwe were up there and I just pushed him\ninto the microphone. So he -- and he --\nand he just started kind of babbling and -- and -- and then saying names\nof people who had helped us. And then I was next to him and I\nwas just screaming the names. So he would say,\nlike, \"Chris Moore.\" And I'd go, \"Chris Moore!\" And he'd go, \"John Gordon,\" I'd go, \"John Gordon!\"\n-\"Gordon! Gordy! Gordy?\" -I was just so happy.\nAnd like -- But that was -- that was\nmy contribution to the speech. -Isn't that fun?\n-I was like, the hype man\nin the corner, you know? -Do you still have that passion and that love of the movies\nand the industry? -Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, well, that's one of the\nreasons we started this company. Ben and I started this kind\nof mini studio together, and this was our first movie\nfor the studio, which was really cool. -What's it called again? -Artists Equity.\n-Artists Equity. -Yeah, yeah.\nBecause we're pulling a lot of the crew members, we're trying\nto pull them above the line and get them paid better. And, you know,\nwe kind of feel like -- [ Cheering and applause ]\nYeah, yeah. -Good for you.\nI read about that. -But it's definitely like\na white knuckle exercise because we're responsible\nfor the overages, you know? So it's like --\n-Did you go over budget? -In three places\nwe went over budget. We went over budget,\nbut in all really good places. We went over budget\nin construction because we were moving so fast that we had\nthe construction teams working 24 hours a day\nto build the sets because or else we were going to\nrun out of stuff to shoot. So we had budgeted 33 days\nand we shot this in 24. So we were moving really fast\nwithout even trying to. And then we went over\nwith our -- we had budgeted, we had allotted a certain\namount of money for cast and then we got this cast,\nso we paid more. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -And we were very happy\nto pay more. And then we went over\nbudget on food trucks. Because we had food trucks. -You're a smart guy.\nYou know how to throw a party. -Well, we've been doing this\nfor a long time, and we know what matters. People were\ncoming out and, like, \"There's a Korean\nbarbecue truck.\" -Yeah, that's\nexactly right, dude. It makes everyone happy.\n-Yeah, it was really, really -- It was the most fun either of us\nhave ever had making a movie. And we've had a lot of fun\nmaking movies. -I said it before,\nbut I really mean it. You're one of the best actors\nto do it, and I love watching you.\nIt's amazing. You're great. You're -- I think that you've,\nfor me, like, if it was a team,\nyou're my go to player. If you're on my team, I go,\njust give the ball to Matt. He'll nail the line.\nYou go, \"How do you like them\napples,\" or, you know, \"Ford vs Ferrari,\" or like,\nyou know, this stopwatch thing. You're like, \"You want one?\nThey're Italian.\" It's like, yes! You have the way\nof delivering these lines that the crowd goes nuts. When I watched \"Air,\"\nyou had a couple of them. Everyone just claps. Like, do you go\ninto a script going, \"Oh, that line will be my --\nthat'll be the line I nail\"? -No, no, no. -You just read it\nand just do it. -Yeah, yeah.\nAnd I mean, you know, I look at the whole script and usually\nif it's a good script, then it'll have lines in it. But I won't kind of plan\nit out like that. I mean, \"how do you like them\napples\" was kind of a very -- because I'm slamming the number\nagainst the window and all that. So that definitely felt\nlike a bigger thing because it's a bigger thing\nin the movie. But not -- I didn't think it\nwould, like, sustain, you know. -Is that the line\nthat everyone yells to you when they see you?\n-That, or they just say my name like the puppet in\n\"Team America.\" -Yeah, that's the other way\nto do it too. -That's the other one\nI hear a lot. Yeah. -Well, when you --\nwhen you get this idea, you go,\nokay, this is a fantastic idea. This is how kind of the industry\nchanged, you know? And a sneaker company\nstarted working with one person. You created\nthe Air Jordan brand. You go, okay, first steps. We have to talk\nto Michael Jordan. -Yeah.\n-I'm assuming. -Yeah, that was the first thing. Well, because the script was\ngreat -- -Can't make it without him.\n-Well -- Well,\nhe's not in the movie. You do realize\nhe's not in the movie. And that's all by design because\nit's really about -- it's about that deal to make\nthis shoe and going back to 1984 and Nike was not Nike\nlike the Nike we know. They were like this underdog. They were in third place\nin the basketball division. -That was, like, already\nblew me away. When that came up, I'm like,\n\"Oh, yeah, it was Converse\" -- -Converse and Adidas,\n-Then Adidas and then Nike. -Yeah. And I'd -- I mean,\nI didn't -- I read the script and I was like, blown away. I was like, this is all true?\n-Yeah> -So that's I think, you know,\nAlex, the screenwriter, did a really good job\nof kind of setting what things looked like in 1984. And -- and it just was\nreally surprising. -And did you have a meeting\nwith Michael or did you make Ben do that?\n-I made Ben do that. -Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\"Ben, come on. Charm him.\" -No, Ben went down\nto talk to him, and actually, that was the kind\nof the critical thing, because we -- out of that\nmeeting, Michael -- Michael --\nBecause, first of all, we said, look,\nlook, we're not going to do it. If you don't want us to do it,\nwe're not going to do it. And he was like, No, no,\nit's a good idea for a movie. But Ben said, what is --\nwhat's most important that we get right? Like, what's most\nimportant to you? And what he spoke about\nwere three things. There was Howard White, who's an executive that\nChris Tucker plays in the movie. -Oh, he was great!\n-Yeah, he's awesome. And George Raveling,\nwho Marlon Wayans plays. George Raveling\nwas the first person who talked to Michael\nabout Nike. And then he talked at length\nabout his mother. And that was kind of\nthe critical thing. It was like, oh, wait a minute, You know, you know,\nto see like Michael, who's very intimidating dude, you know, suddenly kind of\nbe awestruck and talk about his mom. And so that was --\nso when Ben said like, \"Look, who do you think\nwe should get to play\" -- and before he finished\nthe sentence, the question, Michael was like,\n\"Viola Davis.\" -Yeah.\n-So, Ben -- [ Cheering and applause ]\n-Yeah, yeah. -I mean, Viola Davis. -That's who you go to,\nto hit the shot, by the way. -Yeah, that's who you go to. Yeah, you give it\nto Viola Davis. -So he called me. He was like,\n\"I got great news and bad news.\" And I'm like, okay.\nAnd he's like, The great news is I know exactly\nwhat to do for the rewrite. Like, we got, we're going to put\nin George Raveling, we're going to\nput in Howard White, and we're going to make -- make his mom central to\nthe whole thing. And I go, \"Great,\nwhat's the bad news?\" He goes, \"We have to get\nViola Davis or we can't make the movie.\" -You're like,\nAll right, all right. That is -- because\neveryone wants Viola Davis. -That's what I said to Ben.\nI was like, that's like saying you want Michael Jordan\non your basketball team. -Exactly.\nIt's a good way to put it. Yeah. -So we went and we rewrote\nand we -- and we really just kind of drilled down\non that -- on that character and the dynamic between her\nand everybody else in the movie. -She was phenomenal.\n-She's phenomenal. -She's great.\nAnd it's so well done, well acted, well written.\nEverything was good. It's funny as well, by the way.\n-Yeah. It doesn't seem like something\nthat would be a great movie. It's like, it's about\na shoe deal, like. But trust me,\nit's really -- it's great. -You're cheering --\n-It's a lot of fun. -By the end -- oh!\nNo, it makes you feel good. -Yeah. Yeah. That's what we used\nto call \"a feel good movie.\" -Feel good movie of the year.\nYeah. And it's like at the end,\nyou're like, standing ovation and clapping, like, \"Yes,\nI'm so happy for everybody!\" It's wild. You're getting\nfantastic reviews. A lot of critics are saying this\nis the best movie of the year so far,\nso congratulations. -It's only April.\n-That's true. Yeah. -We haven't seen\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" yet. -That's true. Yeah.\nWe have to wait this weekend. Matt, your new movie,\n\"Air,\" is all about Nike and Michael Jordan.\nSo I thought it would be fun to play a game of basketball\nwith a twist. This is beer pong basketball.\nHere we go. Now, here's how this works. We're going to be\nthrowing these basketballs into those giant red cups. If you make a shot,\nyour opponent chugs a beer. First one to make\nthree shots wins. Matt, you're my guest,\nso why don't you go first? -All right.\nDo I have to hit a particular -- -Not as easy as it looks.\nLet me show you how it works. -Not as easy as it looks.\n-Yeah. Watch this. Oh... Oh, yeah! Off the board!\n[ Laughs ] Off the board on that one. Yeah.\nThat's good. We can go to commercial right\nnow, if you want. -Oh, man.\n-Ho, ho, ho, ho! -I was sure that was in. I was sure that was in.\n-Me too. I was sure. -This one --\nOh! -This is brutal. Am I allowed to get it\nin the same one? All right. All right. [ Cheering and applause ] -All right. -Phew. So it's --\nthis one's for the win. -This is for the win.\nOh, man. -Like, \"can I get it\"\nin the one exact one? Yeah, you did.\nYou called that shot. All right,\nhere we go for the win. Matt Damon's movie \"Air\"\nis out tonight. You can go see it in theaters.\n-You're saying this because you think\nyou're going to hit the shot. -I'm just kidding.\nI'm just kidding. -What's up?

And Lake Stevens, Washington, and people would go\nget out of their car and go into the mini mart and I would be hidden\nin the Viking Drive In over the intercom\nand I would mess with them. I'd be like,\n\"Hey, buddy, I need your help.\" [ Laughter ] -People looking around.\n\"Who's saying that?\" Yeah, yeah, exactly. -I'd be like, \"It's me. God.\" [ Laughter ] It was awesome.\n-Coming from a drive-through speaker like, \"This is the\ncalling, God talking to me.\" -It was pretty great.\n-But it must have been good to have your own\npocket money at 14. -Yeah. Yeah, it was good.\nWell, here's a lesson I learned because the lady who\nwho owned the place was like, \"Listen, if you ever\nwant to eat something, you just eat something. Just make sure\nyou write it down. We'll give it you for half price and then we'll just\ntake it out of your check.\" I was like, \"Cool.\" So it was\nkind of a credit system. -Yeah.\n-And I worked there -- I think I got paid every two weeks\nand I got my first check and they were like,\n\"Okay, let's just see.

I was about 13 years old, but I\nactually loved comic books. I didn't have any, 'cause they\nwere expensive, you know? It was like\n5 bucks apiece or something. My friends Travis and Forrest, they collected\n\"Wolverine\" and \"Punisher,\" and they each had a number 1. And I was like,\n\"You got to get a number 1,\" 'cause I thought\na number 1 comic book, that's going to put you\nthrough college one day.

So my brother dug that up,\nand he was like, \"Dude, did you know we have -- You bought that comic book\nwhen you were a kid.\" And so, this is where\nit starts to get weird. I was in London, and I was\nat this Bellator MMA fight. It's kind of like an MMA,\nkind of like the UFC, a big fight.\n-Yep. -And this guy --\n-You're into that, you love it. -I love that stuff, yeah. And these guys just beat\nthe crap out of each other. I was having\nthe time of my life. I was sitting next to 50 Cent.

And the guy who won,\nthis champion, named Michael \"Venom\" Page,\ncomes out, and they bring him\nan Infinity Gauntlet, and they slide it on his hand,\nand he's the victor. And he looks and notices me,\nand points to me outside of the cage. And meanwhile,\n50 Cent is playing, and 50 Cent is right next to me.\n[ Laughter ] And the guy's\ngot an Infinity Gauntlet, and it was like déjà vu. It was one of those moments where your life\nand your destiny intersect. [ Laughter ]\n-Well, I mean -- -And I -- And it was just\nthe craziest thing. I thought for certain\nI was gonna wake up. -Lookit!\n-Where would you just have something like this\nlying around? -He didn't know\nI was gonna be there.

That was a good yawn!\n-I didn't even do \"holding in a yawn.\" I just tried\nto make you me laugh. -You made me laugh.\nAll right, that's an interesting strategy.\nI like that. I was actually\ntrying to swallow one. All right.\nLet's do another one here.

Your \"pretending\nto hold a yawn\" face. -Yeah.\n[ Laughter ] -That's the only face you make.\nIt's very funny. It's very funny.\n-I won't do it again. That's good.\nHere we go.

This one is --\nOh, you'll be good at this. -Yeah, I got this one. -\"Velociraptor is standing\nright behind you.\" -Like, you're trying\nto convey to a person that they're standing\nright behind you, or -- Yeah, yes, 'cause otherwise,\nyou wouldn't know if it was standing behind you.\n-No, I think you would know. -I'm telling you\nthat a velociraptor is standing behind you,\nor am I just -- -Would you know? -'Cause if they're standing\nbehind you, I'd just be making this face.\nI wouldn't know. -I know, but what --\n-They're sneaky. -Oh, they are sneaky.\n-I wouldn't know. -You wouldn't really know? -I'd know.\n-Right.

No, no, no.\nYou like mushrooms. -Yeah.\n-That's right. Yeah. Last time you were here,\nwe had the best time. I appreciate you\ncoming to the show. And you were very nervous\nand excited because your wife, Katherine, was very pregnant\nand was about to have a baby. -That's right.\n-And you had your phone out. -Just in case.\n-You go, \"Just in case anything goes down just\nduring this interview.\" And...?\n-We had a deal that if she was born while I was on the show\nthat I would name her Jimmy. -Questlove? [ Drum roll ] -She's named Eloise 'cause she\nwas not born... -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow.\n[ Sad tuba ] Beautiful name, though.\nNo, no, beautiful. -Bohm-bohm!

She's -- She's the best. She's so girly. She's so cute. She loves dresses and bows\nand all of the princessy stuff. Pink is her favorite color. And she loves to chat.\nShe's a real chatterbox. She'll talk -- She was talking\nto my sister on FaceTime, and then my sister later said,\nshe goes, \"Lyla is like the personification of a Mad Lib\n'cause she knows all these words, but she doesn't quite\nknow how to really use them.\" So she'll -- The other day,\nshe said, \"Daddy, Daddy. I'm going to Palm Beach\nin two minutes!\" [ Laughter ] I said, \"You are?\"\nShe said, \"Yes. I'm going with Santa Claus. We are going to bring\nall of the sand.\" -Yeah. Yeah. -I was like, \"That's exactly\na Mad Lib.\" -Give me a noun. Give me a noun. -Give me an adjective.\n-Yeah. And how's Grandpa? Arnold Schwarzenegger\nis your grandpa. -Yeah. He goes by \"Opa.\" -Oh.\n-You know, he's Austrian. German. \"Opa\" is \"grandfather\"\nin German. So he goes by \"Opa.\" -[ As Arnold ]\nDid he have a cigar? -Oh. [ Laughs ] -Did you have a cigar with him?\n-Yes. Yes. -Yes. You had the cigar?\n-Yeah. -[ Normal voice ]\nHe loves his cigar. -He loves his cigar.\n-He came on the show. He taught me\nhow to smoke a cigar. -Yeah, he kind of taught me,\ntoo. I mean, there's nothing manlier than Arnold Schwarzenegger\nsmoking a cigar. And when you're part of, you\nknow, bringing his granddaughter into the world, he comes\nand he brings you a cigar and he's like, \"Let's go out\nand smoke these.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\" but I have asthma,\nso I don't like cigars. And I was like,\n\"You got it, Arnold.\" And Katherine's like,\n\"What are you doing?\" I was like, \"I'm fine.\nI'm gonna be okay.\" And so I go and I smoke\nthe cigar and I'm like, \"This is good. [ Coughs ]\nHmm. Oh, yeah. Cohiba? Nice.\" And then woke up the next day. Massive lung infection, but... [ Laughter ] Worth it.\n-You always have to -- If Arnold says,\n\"Let's smoke a cigar...\" -You go, \"Okay.\"\n-Let's do it. Yeah. You go, \"Yeah.\" -There's peer pressure, and then there's...\n-Arnold Schwarzenegger. -...Arnold Schwarzenegger\npressure. -No, you do whatever --\nHe came on. I said I want to understand it\nand how to do it and everything, because I smoked\na couple of cigars. I don't know when. And I'm\nlike -- You bite the end off and then you, like,\nlick the side. He goes [As Arnold] \"You don't\nbite and lick it. What are you talking about?\nYou don't lick the cigar! You don't lick it and bite it!\" [ Normal voice ]\nI go, \"I think I did.\" He's like, \"No!\" He goes, [As Arnold] \"Next time I'm in\ntown, I'll teach you. I'll take you to a cigar bar,\nand I'll teach you how.\" [ Normal voice ] I go --\nAnd he's a man of his word. Called me on the phone.\n-No. -Said, \"Jimmy, it's Arnold.\nI'm going to a cigar bar.\" And I was with -- I was with\nDrew Barrymore and my wife, and I go, \"Do you guys want to\ngo to a cigar bar with Arnold Schwarzenegger?\"\nThey're like, \"Let's do it.\" We showed up,\nand we all smoked cigars. -Come on.\n-It was the best. Love that dude. Congrats, Opa. Opa?\n-Opa Arnold. -Congratulations, Opa.\n[ Cheers and applause ] -Stogies. -Congrats to you and Katherine. -Thanks, man. Thank you.\nYeah, we're blessed. We feel very blessed.\n-Good, nice parents. I want to talk\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" because that is --\nThat's the jam. I'm excited about\nthis Wednesday. -Let's go.\n[ Cheers and applause ] -I'm excited.\n-Go see it. -You're Mario. -I'm Mario.\nI'm the voice of Mario. -So what happens when you get\nthe phone call and they're like, \"Hey, would you like to be\nthis iconic...\" -I'm like, \"Pfft. No.\"\n[ Laughter ] -Yeah. Exactly. -I was like, \"Oh, my God!\nReally?!\" Yeah, I mean, you get that call. And it's just really exciting\nbecause, I mean, if you think about it, all the IP that's out\nthere, anything that has reach, it's already been remade. It's already been turned into\na TV show or a movie. And for some reason,\nthe Super Mario Bros. hasn't been a movie\nfor almost 30 years. And it's because I think the\nfolks at Nintendo just didn't want to give anybody the\npermission to make the movie, and so finally they made... -Oh, Illumination is --\n-Illumination, you know -- \"Despicable Me,\"\n\"Secret Life of Pets.\" -\"Minions.\" Brilliant.\n-\"Minions.\" Incredible studio.\nAnd so they partnered up and they decided that they were\ngoing to make this movie. And so when something like that\ncomes around, it's just like -- you're so blessed, so honored\nto do it, I mean, for me... -It's fantastic.\nIt's gonna crush, buddy. And, you know, I was thinking\nabout you because I was watching it,\nand there's a lot of action. There's a lot of action\nin this movie. And I could just kind of hear\nyou -- a lot of grunting by you. -Yes.\n-Going like... [ Grunting ] And I go -- I was like -- \"Oh,\nmaybe Chris will bring footage,\" of you doing those grunts\nwhen you come on the show. I just want to see you in\nthe sound booth going like... [ Both grunting ] -Well, you know, here's\nan interesting thing about that, actually. Usually the effort sounds you do\nat the end of the session. You probably do like one or two\nsessions a month over the course of a couple years to voice one\nof these movies. And at the end, because\nthe efforts and the grunts and the screaming, that really\ntakes it out of your voice, they save that for the end. But here's an interesting\nlittle tidbit. In a -- What makes physical\ncomedy work in like a \"Tom and Jerry\"\nor a \"Super Mario Bros.\" is when a character falls\na long way and hits, they don't die, right? If they died, it would --\nIf Tom and Jerry -- If, like, Road Runner -- If,\nlike, the anvil hit his head and there's freaking brains\neverywhere... -No, no, no, no, no.\nThat'd be terrible. [ Laughter ]\n-Be like, \"Oh, my God!\" That'd be bad, right?\n-Terrible idea. Terrible. -So in order to let kids know\nthat the character's not dead... -Yes.\n-...you have to do an, \"I'm okay, I'm alive\" sigh. \"I'm hurt, not injured\" sigh. So it's like this.\nYou're like, \"Aaaaaah!\" Unh! Uhh... -Yeah!\n[ Applause ] -Without that... [ Cheers and applause ] -It just goes, hey, it's a joke,\neverybody. -Kids will be like,\n\"Mario is dead! Mario fell to his death, Dad!\"\n-That's so funny. It's so well-done.\nIt's such a great cast. Everyone's so talented and good.\nA lot of fun people. -Good luck. -Super Mario Bros. -Boom! Let's see the answer! [ Ding! ]\nYes! Super Mario Bros.! -Wow.\n-Wow. That was a hard question.\n-How was that a hard question? -James. Oh, yo! [ Mario power-up sound plays ]\n-[ Laughs ] -How was that a hard question?

      "page_content": "-Welcome back, everybody. We are here with the one\nand only Michelle Obama. Now... [ Cheers and applause ] We're always so happy\nyou come on the show. Thank you very much.\nI noticed that you went back -- you went back\nto the White House recently. You haven't been back.\n-No. Wasn't invited. [ Laughter ] Ooh, shade. [ Laughter ] -Wow. Wow. I'm adding a chapter right here.\nHold on. -Oh, yeah.\n-And so you return. What did it feel like\nto go back and you go, \"Oh, yeah, I lived\na lot of time in this place\"? -We were -- We were good\nwhen it was time to go. No, it was really\na beautiful experience because, you know,\nthat's a tradition. You do your official portraits. The next president is supposed\nto invite you back to hang them. We were never invited back. So these pictures had been done\nfor a long, long time. But it's also a chance\nfor the staff to come back and reminisce\nand to be together. It's a -- It's a ritual.\nSo it was good to see everybody. It was good to see\nall of the staff. I mean, as quiet as it's kept, my girls lived\nin the White House longer they lived any house.\n-Yeah. -So that's where they grew up. So to go back and to see all\nthe staff that are still there, to see all the people\nthat they grew up with, it was really -- Well, the girls weren't there\nat the time, but it was good for\nBarack and I to see everyone. -Do you ever have dreams\nthat you still live there? -Oh! No. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that\nlike that. It's like -- No, no, I don't --\nI don't have dreams. -You don't ever go like,\n\"Oh, yeah, I'll go down the steps here and do that.\"\n-No. No. Funny story. At Biden's inauguration, all the formers gathered, and they were doing\na public service announcement. And then we had to leave. And this is the first time\nBarack attended -- I think he was there\nwhen somebody else's presidential motorcade was out. So he walks out,\nand usually the first car up is the President, right? And he goes walking to the first\ncar, and his security is like, \"Sir, um, that's not --\nthat's not your car.\" -Oops.\n-He's like, \"Oh.\" He's like, \"Okay.\nWell, where do I go?\" So we had to pass\nthe presidential motorcade, then the VP, and then we went\nway back, and then it was ours. Because you go\nin descending order. -You're like,\n\"But I was just...\" -But the thing was,\nwe were so glad to get in that back motorcade\nand to go home... -Yeah.\n-...to our house. -To your actual house. -You know, that's\nthe progress of democracy. You do your time,\nyou pass it on, you let the next president lead. And so it was --\nit's kind of a relief. -In this book, there's so many great stories\nabout your life, but there's also tips\non how to deal with what we're dealing with,\nwith everything, with what we all --\nisolation with COVID. And just everything is kind of\ntouched in this book. And one thing I loved\nis \"the power of small.\" -Yeah, yeah, that's one of\nthe early chapters because -- I wrote this chapter\nparticularly for young people who are feeling so anxious\nabout the state of the world. I mean, no wonder. Climate change,\nriots on Capitol Hill, gun violence, on and on. And these young kids,\nyoung kids as young as 15, are trying to figure out\nhow to solve these problems, and they're getting all twisted because they don't yet\nhave the power because they're trying to\nbite off too much, too soon. And so \"the power of small\"\nis to focus on what you can\nuniquely control. And for a kid in high school, it's graduating\nfrom high school. You know, get your education\nbecause you can't do that -- You can't end violence\nin your neighborhood unless you focus\non what's at hand. So starting small,\neven for us as adults, is about focus\non your own knitting because there's power in that. You know, if each of us\njust raise the children we bring into the world -- you know, if we did nothing else\nbut do that -- oh, just imagine\nwhere we would be as a nation, as a human race,\nif we just took care of that, if we showed them\nthe love and the focus and if we put our time\nand energy into that instead of trying to solve\nall the big problems. So change happens\nin small bites. It's not just the big stuff. -Yeah, because it starts small, then it goes to a family,\nthen it goes to a community. And it was great.\nThere's also a chapter dedicated to\n\"when they go low, we go high.\" -Well, people\nstill keep asking me, \"You still mean that?\"\n-Yeah. But that was --\nthat was an epic line. That was just --\nIt stuck in everyone's head. Did you realize how powerful\nthat would be years after? -No, no. I didn't know\nI'd be known for that line. But I'm proud of that. People ask me,\ndo I still -- do I ever go low? And, yeah, I go low. -You do.\n-I go low a lot of times. But I think for people\nwho have a platform, who are being looked up to, we have a responsibility\nto stay high because kids are watching us. If you need to go low,\ngo low at home. Do it with your kitchen table,\nwith your spouse. But we set the example,\nbecause leaders set the tone. And we felt what it felt like\nto be led with low, and it didn't feel great. That's why it's important.\nIt's a practice. It's a habit. It's something we show\nthe next generation, that we don't --\nThat doesn't mean we settle. That doesn't mean\nwe're complacent. It means we think\nbefore we speak, because words matter,\nand I still believe that. And I try the best that I can\nwhen I'm in the public eye, when I know that kids\nare watching, to stay high\nbecause high begets high. -That's right. [ Cheers and applause ] Now, uh... you went on a book tour\naround the country, and you had\namazing conversations with amazing people. Our pal Gayle King, who we love.\nTyler Perry. -Lots of great people.\n-Hoda Kotb. -David Letterman.\n-David Letterman. -Oh, so many.\nSure. Conan O'Brien. Sure. -Alright. Alright.\nYou were busy. -Yeah, yeah. It's interesting. But, you know,\nthere's always time for another book, you know?\nUm... But the list is --\nAmazing people. And you turned it\ninto a podcast. -Yeah.\n-And this is great. It's a great thing.\nYou have to listen to it. It's such great conversation.\n-\"The Light Podcast.\" So, for those\nwho missed the book tour, we've recorded\nevery conversation, edited down\nto the best of the best. And, you know,\nit touches on the book, but we also each share\nour own stories of finding light and developing friendships\nand relationships. It's really a fun\nset of conversations that are now on Audible. -And then you have --\nOne of the interviews or the conversations\nare with Oprah Winfrey. -The one and only.\n-Yeah. Oprah Winfrey. And it airs --\n-That Oprah. -That Oprah. And it's airing on April 25th\non Netflix as a special. -Yeah, that will be televised\nbecause when you're with Oprah, you just televise it. -I just feel like, yeah,\nyou have to televise it. Yeah, but you have\nactually become friends with Oprah Winfrey.\nYou guys are really -- -I mean, Oprah was one of\nthe very early supporters before Barack\nwas even thinking about running. I mean, she spotted him\nwhen he was a U.S. senator. And she has sort of been -- Oprah is that person\nwho never asks for anything but is always there with her\ngenerosity and love and support. There isn't anything\nyou can't ask her to do if you're a friend\nthat she won't try to do. She is who she appears to be.\n-Yeah. -And I am lucky\nto call her a friend. -I want to show a clip\nfrom your special. Here's a look\nat \"The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama\nand Oprah Winfrey.\" -When you first arrived\nin Hawaii, you were looking for --\nand I understand why -- You were a working woman\nand had never been to Hawaii. So you're looking for the Hawaii\nin \"Hawaii Five-0.\" Those of you who remember\nthat show. -Mai Tais\nand sunsets on the beach. -And honeymoon suites.\n-Instead... -Yeah, instead, it was a trip\nhome to visit his family. That's where he was from. He wasn't going back\nto some island vacation. He was going back\nto be with his people. But I was young and I was --\nIt was cold in Chicago, and I thought, \"I'm going\nto Hawaii with my man. It's going to be so romantic.\" [ Laughter ] And then we landed,\nand we went straight to Toot and Gramps' apartment.\nNo ocean. It was a high-rise building. Go up to the 10th floor.\nYou know, walk in. Looks like\nmy grandparents' house. Might as well be on\nthe South Side of Chicago. -[ Laughs ]\nIt's not reality. I love it.

      "page_content": "-It's a party. -It feels good. It feels good when you -- -Yeah, it's a party. -Thank you. Welcome back. And thank you for stopping by. And thank you for -- -Thanks for having me. -Thanks for playing yet again. We did another fun -- -We have played so much. -We've had so many fun bits. -You know, the first crazy skit I did, if you all recall, was -- -In the White -- -In the White House. And we did a potato-sack race in the East Room. [ Laughter ] -That's right. We did. You were the first silly I had. [ Laughter ] -I like being the first silly. I love that. -So, thank you for that. -I gotta say, I love having you. I love talking to you, obviously. But to see people's reaction to you next to you, it makes me feel so good. People love you. I mean, we all love you, but we really -- [ Cheers and applause ] -Aww, you guys... -[ Speaking indistinctly ] -Look, I don't take it for granted. Look, we don't get out much. -Oh, yeah. -So it's just nice to hear what it all meant to people, particularly young people. So I don't take any of that for granted. -Do you ever get starstruck anymore, or...? -Oh. Pfft! Questlove. -Oh, come on. Oh, come on. -Hi, hi! [ Both laugh ] Absolutely I get starstruck. -You do? -Well, maybe not exactly right now, in this moment, but in the course of my life... -What? -I mean, you just imagine the people that we met. Stevie? You know, when I first met Stevie Wonder? -Yes, of course. -I mean, I was just like, \"Stevie!\" I fangirled out. -You have to, yeah. -You know, Prince, I mean... [ Cheers and applause ] Prince played at the White House months before he passed, actually. And just -- I know. It was just -- -Isn't he great, the way that Prince was, also, as a person? I've had conversations with your husband about this, too, that everyone is kind of who they should be. -Yeah. -Prince is a magical -- -He appears. -Yes! Yes, he kind of -- Like, a puff of smoke. He just kind of shows up. -He's in the Blue Room, standing in front of President Obama, and he's just like, \"Yo.\" [ Laughter ] -He's just cool. -Still right here. -Yeah, exactly. -So, yes, I fangirl out all the time. -Congratulations on \"The Light We Carry.\" It's another New York Times best seller. And the book -- You dedicate the book to your parents. -Oh, my God. -Which watch I do love. You've talked about the influence that your father had on you, but also as a whole chapter here about your mom, Marion. -Yes. -She deserved a chapter. She's -- She's -- You know, my parents are where I get any wisdom that I have. And the fact that she allowed me to even say her name in the book is a big deal because Marian Robinson isn't impressed with anything at any time. So I had to ask permission. I was like, \"Mom --\" We were trying to get her to write a book. She's like, \"Nobody wants to hear what I have to say.\" I was like, \"No, mom, everybody...\" -Everybody wants to hear, yeah. -\"...wants to hear what you have to say.\" -She does have some great tried and true parenting in the book. Number five is \"Come Home. We will always like you here.\" -Yeah. Yeah. [ Laughter ] That is true. -I mean, let me tell you how grounding that is. And for parents, it's important to remember. Because she said that because she knew that, as kids of color, as women, as a woman, young woman, young Black woman in the world, that I would be confronted with a lot of people who would set my bar low for me. You know, she knew we were going to hear racial insults. She knew what we were going to confront. And she never wanted us to get our self-worth from outside the home because we couldn't count on it. So that maxim is \"Don't sweat the small stuff.\" Don't lose it because a teacher doesn't like you, because somebody called you a bad word. Don't let your self-esteem be based on that. You know, get your self-worth at home. And so that's a powerful thing for all parents to remember. But it's an important thing for adults to remember as we deal with young people, that our words to them matter. You know? -Yeah. -What we say, how we treat them, it has an impact, because some kids don't have a home to go to to feel that love. So I think about that every time I interact with a kid that my interaction with them may be the time they feel safe and they feel at home. So I want everybody to think about that. -That goes far. -So I got that at home. [ Cheers and applause ] -I love that. How, uh... How are the kids? -Kids are good. Those two. -Sasha and Malia. -They're not kids. -Are they still -- -They are grown -- -They're 7 years old? How old are they? [ Laughter ] -That's how the world sees them. Twent-- They'll be 25 and 22. -When did that happen? -Yeah. You all are old. [ Laughter ] When did that happen? -I know. Before our very eyes. All I can say is, no more babies, no more tuition. [ Laughter ] Bye. It's like, \"Here's your life.\" -\"There you go.\" -\"Good luck.\" -Yeah, \"Let me know how it works out.\" Yeah. But now they're living together, right? They're roommates? -Right now they are, yep, yeah. -Do you visit them? -We visited them once. -Okay. -When we're your parents, you don't really want us around that much, you know? [ Laughter ] -Really? -So -- But we did get invited over for cocktails before dinner because we had to take them out to dinner, and they invited us over for cocktails. -No, no, no. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. -No, you don't drink a cocktail. -Oh. Pfft! Not only did they drink it, but they made one. -No! -That was a bad martini. [ Laughter ] It was very weak, in a tumbling glass. [ Laughter ] You know, they stumbled through -- It was mostly vermouth and ice. [ Laughter ] -I still do the same thing. -Well, maybe it wasn't even vermouth, because I don't even think that they knew vermouth was in a martini. -Yeah, that's exactly it. But they're trying to impress you with a martini. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. And a charcuterie tray. -Ooh! -Which they complained about the price of cheese. [ Laughter ] -That's good. -Malia's like, \"Do you know how much I paid for that cheese? [ Laughter ] And I was like, \"Yeah, girl, you eat my cheese all the time.\" -Exactly. -Now you -- -Never worried about the price when you eat my charcuterie tray. It's like... -You've always said when we've talked about the kids that you wanted to give them the most normal childhood that you possibly can while you're living in the White House, which has got to be tough. But I remember when you were saying even Barack coached their basketball team? -Yes. Yeah, he was -- he was dad in the White House. -How did you sneak out and do that, though? How is that possible? -You know, it's amazing. You know, and he wasn't assigned to be the coach. This was fourth grade rec league for little girls. Right? Sasha was playing, and he and Reggie Love, who was his aide at the time, who was a Division I player for Duke, they would sit and watch these girls not have their shoes tied, they weren't running plays, because it was a parent coached league, right? -Yeah. Also, they're in fourth grade. -They're in fourth grade, but Barack Obama felt that they could do better. [ Laughter ] So each game, he would slide closer down to the players bench and whisper to the parent coaches who I'm sure were like, \"Oh, my God, it's the President telling me to run a play.\" Eventually, he took over. He had them practicing, he taught them plays. And the funny thing is, like, it wasn't only Sasha on the team, but it was Maisy Biden, Joe's youngest granddaughter. They're very good friends. So imagine it, on any given Sunday, in a rec gym in Chevy Chase -- 'Cause we all came out, right? -Yeah. -You're playing against the Vipers. That was their name. They were the Vipers. -Yeah. -It would be the President, the Vice President, the first, second lady, all the kids and all of our details. [ Laughter ] So you imagine being the poor kids on the other team... [ Laughter ] ...with Joe yelling, \"Maisy, pass the ball!\" [ Laughter ] \"Box out!\" You know, at the time, I would have to tell them, \"Chill out.\" \"You know, this is -- these kids -- I think that little girl is crying 'cause the President's yelling at them.\" [ Laughter ] -How did they end up doing? -They won the championship. -Come on! That's exactly right! [ Cheers and applause ] -♪ The Vipers ♪ -Guys, more with Michelle Obama when we come back. More \"Tonight Show.\" Come on back, everybody.",

And today is the 20th\nanniversary of you guys meeting? -Yeah, This is the day we met\n20 years ago. -Isn't that cool?\n-Yeah. [ Cheers and applause ]\n-That's awesome, buddy. -Yeah, it's really weird.\nActually, um... And the movie, \"Air,\"\nis opening today, and we realized that\nMichael Jordan wore two numbers in his career, 45 and 23,\nand the date is 4/5/23. -Holy --\n-Isn't that crazy? -Yes! Come on! That's fun.\n[ Cheers and applause ] -But much more importantly, it's 20 years\nsince I met Lucy, so... -Of course. Yeah. Yeah,\nthat's much more important. How is the fam?\nLast time we talked, you were moving everyone\nfrom L.A. to New York. -Right. Yeah, we did.\nWe -- We -- It was the smartest thing\nwe ever did. We're loving it.\n-You're here. -Yeah, We're in Brooklyn.\n-Yeah! Good. -Very, very happy. Yeah, yeah.\n[ Cheers and applause ] -You're loving it.\n-Loving it, Loving it. Yeah. -Let's talk about\nthe new movie, \"Air.\" I got to see it,\nand the reviews are in. Everyone loves it.\nIt is fantastic, buddy. -Thank you.\n-You're so good in this. Everyone's good in it,\nby the way. -Everybody's great. I mean, we got just\na lights-out cast. -You really do.\nBut everything was good. The script was tight.\nYou and Ben Affleck, obviously, everyone loves\nyou guys together. You're great.\nThis was 25 years ago. -Oh, yeah.\n-Look at this. When you won the Oscars\nfor \"Good Will Hunting.\" [ Cheers and applause ] Look at how happy --\nLook at this. -We don't --\n-\"Yeaaah!!\" -We don't look too excited.\n-Yeah, I mean, you got to be -- I mean, what's going through --\nDo you remember this? -I do.\nWell, we didn't -- The weird thing about that\nwas that we -- like, the year before,\nwe were watching it on TV. It was like, we had no --\nthere was no adjustment period where we went --\nLike, we just suddenly were kind of there\nin the front row. And Billy Crystal sang a song\nwith our names in it. We were like,\n\"What is happening?\" -\"What is going on\nwith our lives?\" -Yeah. And and we hadn't --\nwe hadn't talked about like, a speech\nor anything like that because I think as kind\nof lifelong Red Sox fans, you know, you don't\nwant to jinx anything, so... -Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n-Because I think both of us, without even talking about it, we were like -- 'Cause later we talked about it, and it was like, I had this\nfeeling, like, if I ever said, \"Hey, we should think\nabout a speech,\" I would just flash-forward\nto being like 50 years later in a bar with him going, \"Can you believe\nwe practiced a speech?\" -Yeah, yeah, yeah!\n\"That's why we lost.\" -That's why.\n-\"Because we practiced. -\"Like we would ever win\nan Oscar.\" You know what I mean?\nAnd then suddenly, we were up there, and I just\npushed him into the microphone. So he --\nAnd he -- And he just started\nkind of babbling and -- and then saying names\nof people who had helped us. And then I was next to him, and I was just\nscreaming the names. So he would say, like,\nChris Moore. And I'd go, \"Chris Moore!\"\n[ Laughter ] And he'd go, \"John Gordon.\"\nI'd go, \"John Gordon!\" -\"John Gordon! Gordon!\nGordie! Gordie!\" -I was just so happy,\nand, like -- But that was -- that was\nmy contribution to the speech. [ Laughter ]\n-Isn't that fun? -I was like the hype man\nin the corner, you know? -Do you still have\nthat passion and that -- that love of the movies\nand the industry? -Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, well, that's one of the\nreasons we started this company. Ben and I started this kind\nof mini studio together, and this was our first movie\nfor the studio, which was really cool.\n-What's it called again? Artists Equity.\n-Artists Equity, yeah. -Yeah. 'Cause we're pulling\na lot of the crew members. We're trying to pull them\nabove the line and get them paid better. And -- And, you know,\nwe kind of feel like -- [ Cheers and applause ]\n-Yeah. -Yeah.\n-Good for you. -So...\n-I read about that. -But it's definitely,\nlike, a white-knuckle exercise because we're responsible\nfor the overages, you know? So it's like...\n[ Laughter ] It's like, \"Oh!\"\n-Did you go over budget? -In three places\nwe went over budget. We went over budget,\nbut in all really good places. We went over budget\nin construction because we were moving so fast that we had\nthe construction teams working 24 hours a day\nto build the sets or else we were gonna\nrun out of stuff to shoot. So we had budgeted 33 days\nand we shot this in 24. So we were moving really fast\nwithout even trying to. And then we went over\nwith our -- we had budgeted -- we had allotted a certain\namount of money for cast, and then we got this cast,\nso we paid more. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -And we were very happy\nto pay more. And then we went\nover budget on food trucks. [ Laughter ]\nBecause we had food trucks. -You're a smart guy.\nYou know how to throw a party. -Well, we've been doing this\nfor a long time and we know what matters. And, like, you know,\npeople are coming out, and they'd be like, \"There's a\nKorean barbecue truck.\" -Yeah!\nThat's exactly right! Dude, it makes everyone happy. -Yeah, it was really, really -- It was the most fun either of us\nhave ever had making a movie, and we've had a lot of fun\nmaking movies. -I said it before,\nbut I really mean it. You're one of the best actors\nto do it. And I love watching you act.\nIt's amazing. You're great. [ Cheers and applause ] I think that you've --\nFor me, like, if it was a team,\nyou're my go-to player. If you're on my team, I go,\n\"Just give the ball to Matt. He'll -- He'll nail the line.\"\nYou go, \"How do you like them apples,\"\nor, you know, \"Ford v. Ferrari,\" you're like,\nyou know, the stopwatch thing. You're like, \"You want one?\nThey're Italian.\" It's like, \"Yes!\"\nYou have the way of delivering these lines that, like,\nthe crowd goes nuts. When I watched \"Air,\"\nyou had a couple of them. Everyone just claps. Like,\ndo you go into a script going, \"Oh, that line will be my --\nthat'll be the line I nail\"? -No, no, no. -You just read it\nand just do it. -Yeah, yeah. And I mean, you know, I --\nI look at the whole script, and usually\nif it's a good script, then it'll have lines in it. But I won't kind of plan\nit out like that. I mean, \"How do you like them\napples\" was kind of a very -- 'cause I'm slamming the number\nagainst the window and all that. So that definitely\nfelt like a bigger thing because it's a bigger thing\nin the movie. But not -- I didn't think\nit would, like, sustain. -Do people --\nIs that the line that everyone yells to you\nwhen they see you? -That or they just say my name like the puppet\nin \"Team America.\" [ Laughter ]\n-Yeah, that's the other way to do it, too, yeah. -Yeah, that's the other one\nI hear a lot. Yeah. -Well, when you --\nwhen you get this idea, you go, \"Okay.\nThis is a fantastic idea.\" This is how kind of\nthe industry changed, you know? And a sneaker company\nstarted working with one person. You created\nthe Air Jordan brand. You go, \"Okay. First steps. We have to talk\nto Michael Jordan.\" -Yeah.\n-I'm assuming. -Yeah, that was\nthe first thing. Well, because\nthe script was great -- -Can't make it without him.\n[ Laughter ] -Well, he's not in the movie.\n-No. -You do realize,\nhe's not in the movie. And that's all by design\nbecause it's really about -- it's about that deal\nto make this shoe and going back to 1984, and Nike was not Nike,\nlike the Nike we know. They were like this underdog.\nThey were in third place in the basketball division.\n-That already blew me away. When that came up, I'm like,\n\"Oh, yeah.\" It was Converse and then -- -Converse, then Adidas,\nand then Nike. -Yeah. And I -- I mean,\nI didn't -- I read the script, and I was, like, blown away.\nI was like, \"This is all true?\" -Yeah,\n-But so that's -- I think, you know, Alex,\nthe screenwriter, did a really good job\nof kind of setting what things\nlooked like in 1984. And it just was\nreally surprising. -So, did you have a meeting\nwith Michael, or did you make Ben do that? -I made Ben do that.\n-Yeah, smart. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\"Ben, Come on. Charm him,\" yeah. -No, Ben went down\nto talk to him, and actually, that was kind of\nthe critical thing because -- because we,\nout of that meeting, Michael -- Michael --\nBecause first of all, we said, like, \"Look,\nwe're not gonna do it. If you don't want us to do it,\nwe're not gonna do it.\" And he was like, \"No, no,\nit's a good idea for a movie.\" But Ben said, \"What is --\nWhat's most important that we get right? Like, what's most\nimportant to you?\" And what he spoke about\nwere three things. There was Howard White,\nwho's an executive that Chris Tucker\nplays in the movie. -Oh, he's great.\n-Yeah, he's awesome. And George Raveling,\nwho Marlon Wayans plays. George Raveling,\nwas the first person who talked to Michael\nabout Nike, and then he talked at length\nabout his mother. And that was kind of\nthe critical thing. It was like,\n\"Oh, wait a minute.\" You know -- You know,\nto see, like, Michael, who's very intimidating dude, you know, suddenly\nkind of be awestruck and talk about his mom. And so that was --\nso Ben said like, \"Look, who do you think\nwe should get to play --\" and before he finished\nthe sentence, the question, Michael was like, \"Viola Davis.\"\n-Yeah. So, Ben -- yeah, yeah.\n[ Cheers and applause ] -I mean, Viola Davis. -That's who you go to,\nto hit the shot, by the way. -Yeah, that's who you go to. Yeah, you give it\nto Viola Davis. -So he called me. He was like,\n\"I got great news and bad news.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\"\nAnd he's like, \"The great news is, you know, I know exactly what to do\nfor the rewrite. Like, we're gonna\nput in George Raveling, we're gonna put in Howard White, and we're gonna make his mom\ncentral to the whole thing. And I go, \"Great.\nWhat's the bad news?\" He goes,\n\"We have to get Viola Davis or we can't make the movie.\"\nYou were like, \"All right, all right.\nThat is our mission.\" Because everyone wants\nViola Davis in there. -That's what I said to Ben.\nI was like, that's like saying you want Michael Jordan\non your basketball team. -Yeah, exactly!\nIt's a good way to put it. Yeah.\n-So we went, and we rewrote, and we really just\nkind of drilled down on that -- on that character\nand the dynamic between her and everybody else in the movie.\n-She was phenomenal. -She's phenomenal.\n-She's great. And it's so well done,\nwell-acted, well-written. Everything was good.\nIt's funny, as well, by the way. -Yeah.\nIt doesn't seem like something that would be a great movie. It's like,\n\"It's about a shoe deal?\" -Yeah, yeah.\n-But trust me, it's really -- It's great.\nIt's a lot of fun. -By the end --\n[ Cheers and applause ] -Yeah.\n-No, it makes you feel good. -Yeah. Yeah. That's what we used to call\na feel-good movie, right? -A feel-good movie of the year.\nYeah. And it's like, at the end,\nyou're like, standing ovation, clapping, like, \"Yes!\nI'm so happy for everybody.\" It's wild. You're getting\nfantastic reviews. A lot of critics are saying this\nis the best movie of the year so far, so congratulations.\n-It's only April. -That's true. Yeah.\n[ Laughter ] -We haven't seen\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" yet. -That's true. Yeah, yeah. We have to wait for this\nweekend. I want to show a clip. Here's Matt Damon\nand Viola Davis in \"Air.\" Take a look. -Are you Mr. Jordan? -James.\n-Sonny Vaccaro. I'm with Nike. -[ Laughing ] Oh, man.\nHere we go. -Well --\n-James? Who is it?\n-Hello, Missus -- Mrs. Jordan. My name is Sonny Vaccaro.\nI-I'm with Nike. -I believe Mr. Faulk\nmade it clear that we weren't interested. -Yes, I-I was told not to call. -Do you typically make it\na habit of showing up at people's front doors\nunannounced? -Well, maybe the worst\nof all my faults, and believe me, there are many, But I don't like\nto take no for an answer. And I actually think your son\nshould be endorsed by someone with that exact mind-set. -All right.\nCome on back. Take a seat. -Thank you. -Yeah. Come on, bud.

She's -- She's the best. She's so girly.\nShe's so cute. She loves dresses and bows\nand all of the princessy stuff. Pink is her favorite color.\nAnd she loves to chat. She's a real chatterbox.\nShe'll talk -- She was talking to\nmy sister on FaceTime, and then my sister\nlater said, she goes, \"Lyla is like the\npersonification of a Mad Lib 'cause she knows\nall these words, but she doesn't quite know\nhow to really use them.\" So she'll -- The other day,\nshe said, \"Daddy, Daddy. I'm going to Palm Beach\nin two minutes!\" I said, \"You are?\" She said, \"Yes.\nI'm going with Santa Claus. We are going to bring\nall of the sand.\" -Yeah. Yeah. -I was like,\n\"That's exactly a Mad Lib.\" -Give me a noun. Give me a noun.\n-Give me an adjective. -Yeah. And how's Grandpa? Arnold Schwarzenegger\nis your grandpa. -Yeah.\n-He goes by \"Opa.\" -Oh.\n-You know, he's Austrian. German. \"Opa\" is \"grandfather\"\nin German. So he goes by \"Opa.\" -[As Arnold]\nDid he have a cigar? -Oh. [ Laughs ] -Did you have a cigar\nwith him? -Yes. Yes.\n-Yes. You had the cigar? -Yeah.\n-[Normal] He loves his cigar. -He loves his cigar.\n-He came on the show. He taught me\nhow to smoke a cigar. -Yeah, he kind of\ntaught me, too. I mean, there's nothing manlier\nthan Arnold Schwarzenegger smoking a cigar.\n-Yes. -And when you're part of,\nyou know, bringing his granddaughter\ninto the world, he comes and he brings you\na cigar and he's like, \"Let's go out and smoke these.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\"\nbut I have asthma, so I don't like cigars. And I was like,\n\"You got it, Arnold? And Katherine's like,\n\"What are you doing?\" I was like, \"I'm fine.\nI'm gonna be okay.\" And so I go and I smoke\nthe cigar and I'm like, \"This is good. [ Coughs ] Hmm.\nOh, yeah. Cohiba? Nice.\" And then woke up the next day.\nMassive lung infection. But -- Worth it.\n-You always have to -- If Arnold says,\n\"Let's smoke a cigar...\" -You go, \"Okay.\"\n-Let's do it. Yeah. You go, \"Yeah.\"\n-There's peer pressure, and then there's...\n-Arnold Schwarzenegger. -...Arnold Schwarzenegger\npressure. No, you do whatever --\nHe came on. I said I want to understand it\nand how to do it and everything, because I smoked\na couple of cigars. I don't know when. And I'm like --\nYou bite the end off and then you, like,\nlick the side. -He goes by,\n\"You don't bite and the lick. What are you talking about? You don't lick the cigar!\nYou don't lick it and bite it!\" So I go -- I think I did.\nHe's like, \"No!\" He goes, \"Next time\nI'm in town, I'll teach you. I'll take you to a cigar bar,\nand I'll teach you how.\" I go --\nAnd he's a man of his word. Called me on the phone.\n-No. -Said, \"Jimmy, it's Arnold.\nI'm going to a cigar bar.\" And I was with -- I was with Drew Barrymore\nand my wife, and I go, \"Do you guys want to go\nto a cigar bar with Arnold Schwarzenegger?\"\nThey're like, \"Let's do it.\" We showed up,\nand we all smoked cigars. -Come on.\n-It was the best. Love that dude.\nCongrats, Opa. Opa? -Opa Arnold.\n-Congratulations, Opa. -Stogies.\n-Congrats to you and Katherine. -Thanks, man. Thank you.\nYeah, we're blessed. We feel very blessed.\n-Good, nice parents. I want to talk \"Super Mario\nBros.\" because that is -- That's the jam. I'm excited\nabout this Wednesday. -Let's go. -I'm excited.\n-Go see it. -You're Mario.\n-I'm Mario. I'm the voice of Mario.\n-So what happens when you get the phone call\nand they're like, \"Hey, would you like\nto be this iconic...\" -I'm like, \"Pfft. No.\" -Exactly. -I was like,\n\"Oh, my God! Really?!\" Yeah, I mean,\nyou get that call. And it's just really exciting\nbecause, I mean, if you think about it,\nall the IP that's out there, anything that has reach,\nit's already been remade. It's already been turned\ninto a TV show or a movie. And for some reason.\nthe Super Mario Bros. hasn't been a movie\nfor almost 30 years. And it's because I think\nthe folks at Nintendo just didn't want to give\nanybody the permission to make the movie,\nand so finally they made... -Oh, Illumination is --\n-Illumination, you know -- \"Despicable Me.\"\n\"Secret Life of Pets.\" \"Minions.\" Brilliant.\n-\"Minions.\" Incredible studio. And so they partnered up and they decided that they were\ngoing to make this movie. And so when something\nlike that comes around, it's just like --\nyou're so blessed, so honored to do it,\nI mean, for me... -It's fantastic.\nIt's gonna crush, buddy. And, you know,\nI was thinking about you because I was watching it,\nand there's a lot of action. There's a lot of action\nin this movie. And I could just\nkind of hear you -- a lot of grunting by you. -Yes.\n-Going like -- [ Grunting ] And I go -- I was like -- \"Oh, maybe Chris will bring\nfootage,\" of you doing those grunts\nwhen you come on the show. I just want to see you\nin the sound booth going like... [ Both grunting ] -Well, you know, here's\nan interesting thing about that, actually. Usually the effort sounds you do\nat the end of the session. You probably do like\none or two sessions a month over the course\nof a couple years to voice one of these movies. And at the end, because\nthe efforts and the grunts and the screaming, that really\ntakes it out of your voice, they save that for the end. But here's an interesting\nlittle tidbit. In a -- What makes\nphysical comedy work in like a \"Tom and Jerry\"\nor a \"Super Mario Bros.\" is when a character falls\na long way and hits, they don't die, right?\nIf they died, it would -- If Tom and Jerry --\nIf, like, Road Runner -- If, like, the anvil\nhit his head and there's freaking brains\neverywhere... -No, no, no, no, no.\nThat'd be terrible. -Be like, \"Oh, my God!\"\nThat'd be bad, right? -Terrible idea. Terrible. -So in order to let kids know\nthat the character's not dead... -Yes.\n-...you have to do an, \"I'm okay, I'm alive\" sigh. \"I'm hurt, not injured\"\nsigh. So it's like this.\nYou're like, \"Aaaaaah!\" Unh! Uhh... -Yeah! [ Applause ] -Without that... -It just goes, hey,\nit's a joke, everybody. -Kids will be like,\n\"Mario is dead! Mario fell to his death, Dad!\" -That's so funny.\nIt's so well-done. It's such a great cast. Everyone's so talented and good.\nA lot of fun people. How do we set up the movie\nwith \"Super Mario Bros.\"? -There's a -- There's a clip?\n-Yeah. -You don't have to show it.\nIt's fine. -No, we're definitely\nshowing the clip. But if you want to set it up,\nthey're in Brooklyn. -Oh, this is the --\nI don't know what the clip is. What's the clip? It's from this movie called\n\"The Super Mario Bros.\" And I'm in it.\n-No, but the movie. What is the movie about?\nNot the clip. The movie is about... -It's about the\nSuper Mario Brothers. [ Laughter ] Am I not doing --\nI'm gonna get fired. -No! This is --\nThey're plumbers. -They're plumbers.\n-Right? -There are turtles. You know, they run around.\nIt sounds crazy, but they smash their head\nagainst things... -Yes, yes, yes.\n-...to get coins. -And they go through a pipe and\nthey end up in a weird world. -There's a princess.\n-Seth Rogen plays... -Donkey Kong.\n-Donkey Kong. -Yeah.\nI want to show everyone a clip. -You're gonna love it.\n-Chris Pratt, Keegan-Michael Key in\n\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\" Take a look.\n-Let's go. [ Laughter ] ♪♪ -Do not touch that mushroom!\n-Aah! -You'll die!\n-Ah! -Oh, I'm sorry.\nThat one's perfectly fine. -It's a little mushroom man! A little mushroom man\ntalking to me! -Pleased to meet ya.\nI'm Toad. -Uh, Mario. ♪♪ So this is -- this is --\nthis is not a dream? Aah!\n-That hurt, right? -Yes!\n-Definitely not a dream. -Yeah, it's not a dream. Not a\ndream. Chris Pratt, everybody. Chris and I are doing something\nfun after the break. Stick around.\nCome right back. Don't leave.",

Man. -Couldn't have happened to\na better dude, man. -This is\na dream come true, Jimmy. This is sweet.\n-Come on, bud. -Are you kidding me? -We met each other probably\nalmost a year ago, right? -Yeah, just about a year ago.\nVegas, baby. Vegas. -We were at -- Justin Timberlake\nhad a golf tournament. -Mm-hmm.\n-8:00 a.m. golf tournament. -Yeah, 8:00 a.m. golf tourney. -And we play -- And we never met\neach other, hung out. We hung out all day and we\ntotally hit it off, I thought. -I couldn't\nget away from you, man. -I know. I was kind of a fanboy. I kept following you around\nlike, \"Hey, Travis. Hi, bud. Hi, man.\"\nYeah, exactly. -My favorite part\nwas \"Mustang Sally,\" baby. -Oh, dude. -He jumped up on the stage\nand gave us all -- -We had to rock it out.\nWe had to scream.

This is the second time\nyou won the Super Bowl, bud. -Man, I'll tell you what --\nthe first time was one of the most emotional\nlike, \"I finally did it.\" -Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. -And then we lost to\nthe Tampa Bay Buccaneers, got our tails whupped\npretty good against them. So that was a low moment. And then it kind of\nbuild back up. And to get this one, to be back\non the mountaintop, man, I'll tell you what, it's\nthe best feeling in the world. [ Cheers and applause ]\n-Yeah, buddy. You were so good.\n-Oh, yeah. Especially to do it with\nthe guys we did it with, the ups and downs through it,\nthe adversity of the season. It was a lot of fun, man. -But also to do it with\nPatrick Mahomes. That's where I met you.\nYou guys were together. -Oh, yeah. -Was that a plan for you guys\nto hang out on the off-season and be kind of best friends. -I think it just\nhappened organically. It was just like, \"Hey, man,\nwhat are you doing? You're about to go to Vegas\nand play golf? Alright, let's do it.\"\n-Really? -And it's been awesome since\nhe's been in Kansas City. He doesn't get enough credit for\nthe type of leader that he is, the type of just personable guy\nhe is in the locker room. And it's on and off the field. He does unbelievable things\nin the community in Kansas City. And that's the kind of,\nyou know, vibe that I like\nto be around, man. -Yeah. -And it was just kind of like\nmagnets when he got to K.C. -Yeah, but I --\n'Cause I was thinking, \"Oh, maybe this is a plan. Maybe Andy Reid said, 'Hey,\nyou guys should be best friends. Just go play with each other.'\" -Just compete and --\n-Go to a movie. Go to a movie, go do something, go watch Netflix for an\nafternoon or something, yeah. -It started with the,\n\"Hey, do you drink beers? Do you drink beer?\"\n-Yeah. Yeah. -Because I like to drink beers.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -It sounds like\nwe could have some fun. -Yeah, exactly.\nAnd you guys bonded. I just thought it was great,\nand you have great chemistry and it's real. It's not fake at all. I witnessed it for a weekend.\nIt was, like, so cool to watch. The parade was yesterday.\n-Yes. -So I want to thank you\nfor being here today. -Oh, man,\nI almost didn't make it. -I know, I know, I know, I know,\nI know, I know, I know. I was actually --\nI was thinking about -- I was going to call Jason\nif you didn't show up. I'm like, \"Dude, get over here. [ Cheers and applause ]\nJason, get over here right now.\" Everyone's always\nasking about your brother. But that must have been just\na bizarre thing to be playing in the Super Bowl\nwith your brother. -Man, it was -- You know,\nyou always dream growing up that you're going to one day\nbe in the Super Bowl, especially when my brother's the\nreason why I even play football. Like -- Yeah, exactly. When I was growing up -- I'm two\nyears younger than my brother. And that's about as drunk as\nI was at the parade right there. That's me -That's during\nthe parade yesterday? -Yeah, that's me. That's full parade form\nright there. -Oh, my God. I thought this was when\nyou were a kid. This is yesterday.\n-No, this is yesterday. Yeah, growing up in\nCleveland, Ohio, I followed his footsteps\nin a lot of areas, sports being one of them\nand football definitely being one of them. And you always imagine, you\nknow, playing on the same team, but, man, I'll tell you what,\nthe way the football world and everybody embraced my family\nand me and my brother playing against each other -- for the first time, two brothers\nplaying against each other in the Super Bowl. It was cool to break\nthat barrier and see my family and all the light\nand getting all the glory. Man, it was beautiful. -I mean, 'cause when you were a\nkid, like there -- You're probably in your front\nyard or something? -Yeah, probably\n3 or 5 years old, maybe. -Yeah, and what's\nthe big Super Bowl there? Like, you're like --\nI don't know what it is. Like, Thanksgiving?\n-Exactly. -Like a Turkey Bowl\nor something? -Exactly.\n-Yeah. -Just excited we got costumes and we can look like\nfootball players. -Yeah. Here's you\nand your brother at this year's Super Bowl. -Alright, now.\n-Yeah. All the cameras\ngot you right there saying, \"Hey, I love you, bro.\" [ Cheers and applause ] And I also got to give\na shout-out. Your mom has been the cutest\nfor this whole ride, 'cause everyone is like,\n\"Who are you rooting for? What son do you like better?\"\nYou know, all that stuff. And she's been so cool. And I've got to show you\nthe jacket. Here's what Mama Kelce\nwas wearing. -Split right down the middle\nright there. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\n[ Cheers and applause ] You see the red side's\non that left right there. -Yeah. -It's right there\nnext to that heart. She knows. Mama knows best.\nMama knows best. -I mean, mama knows best. -That right shoe looked way\nbetter than the left shoe. No offense, guys.\nNo offense, guys. -I know this is tough for\nThe Roots to be -- 'Cause they're just such\nPhilly fans. But you know what?\nNo one picked -- Look at this. No one picked you guys to win at\nall, none of the experts. -The experts.\n-The experts. -The experts say that, yeah,\nthe Chiefs were out of it way back in April, I think. We lost a\nbig-name wide receiver, one of my favorite teammates\never, Tyreek Hill, and they thought that it\nwas just -- it was over for us. And that's why being on\nthat mountaintop, man, it just felt\nthat much sweeter, man. -But did you feel --\n[ Cheers and applause ] 'Cause watching the Super Bowl,\nI thought you were out. I've got to be honest. I mean, that second half and when Patrick\nstarted limping off the field, I go, \"Oh, gosh.\" -10-point lead, man. Don't give Pat Mahomes\n10 points, because he will just floor it. -Really?\nHe's like, \"Don't tell me no.\" -Yeah, he got --\nIt will probably go down as one of my favorite speeches. At halftime,\nhe got electric, man. He lit a fire in everybody's\ntail just to, you know, want it that much more. And when you can do that\nwith a group of men, man, that's a special human being\nright there. -Yeah, and you got everyone\nhyped up and you came back. It was an unbelievable comeback. -Second half\nwas a lot of energy, man. A lot of energy.\nA lot of passion. -We have a big announcement that we're going to announce here\non the show tonight. I'm very excited about this. You're going to be back\nin our building in a few weeks. Can you say why\nyou're coming back? -Yeah, for sure.

And it's an absolute honor\nand a privilege to be hosting \"SNL\" March 4th. [ Cheers and applause ]\n♪♪ -Come on, buddy!\nCome on, bud! Yes!

Oh, actually, alright.\n-Doesn't have to involve you. -No, no, oh, this involves me.\n[ Laughter ] We -- I wonder if they know\nabout this. I don't think she does. Growing up I was, God, I don't\neven know how old I was. Like, maybe eight or nine. We were watching TV, and my\nfriend Sam was over watching TV, and my brother pushed me back\ninto a coffee table, and I cracked my head open. And I ended up getting\nfour stitches. But I remember, like, he pushed\nme against the table, and I hit it -- And I had already cracked my\nhead open once, and I was like, \"No blood,\nno blood, no blood.\" And my hand -- it was like\na murder scene. It was like, \"Ah,\nthis is my dream job.\" And I was like, \"Blood!\"\nAnd Chris was like, \"Please don't tell.\"\nAnd I just said that I fell, and I got stitches,\nand, Mom, he pushed me, so... [ Laughter ]\n-Wow. Wow! Wow, okay.\nTake it off. Yeah. Yeah, you have some explaining\nto do here. [ Laughter ]\nYeah, I want to know. I want to know what went down.\n-Oh, no! -Here's the question.\nHere's the question. Don't look.\nDon't look. Don't give any brother hints. -There's no brother hints here. -What is something\nChris did growing up that your parents still\ndon't know about? -Huh. Um -- Wow.\nI mean, there's a few. [ Laughter ] Alright, I'll -- Is it -- is it when I -- -Don't look, don't look at him.\n-Okay. I'll say it's when I made him\ncut school. I was a senior.\nHe was a freshman. I made him cut school and we -- judging by the reaction,\nthat's not right. [ Laughter ]\n-Wait, wait, wait, no. [ Buzzer ]\nFinish it, finish it, finish it. -Well -- oh, I'll finish it.\n-What happened? -I was a senior.\nHe was a freshman. I made him cut school. We went and did\na lot of bad things. [ Light laughter ]\nAnd then we came back to the school and --\n-Did you murder anyone? -We played --\n[ Laughter ] -I got in trouble\nfor cutting class, but -- -What are you\nratting me out for? -You cracked my head open. -Oh!\n-Do remember that? -Scott!\n[ Laughter ] -You know you pushed me.\nListen. -Yeah, but that was between us. [ Laughter ] -This is where your acting\nskills come in. You were like, \"Alright,\ndon't tell mom. Here's how we're going to do --\" \"But I'm a homicide detective.\" -But Ma showed up,\nand he -- he -- he covered -- -I fell.\n-He covered my ass. -I fell --\n-Ah, you're a good brother. See?\n-That was a big deal. Yeah, yeah.\n-Alright. Alright. [ Applause ] -Alright.\nThis is a question for -- -Cutting school was more fun.\n[ Laughter ] -Cutting school was the best. -Scott, that's for you. Just press play on that guy. Ready? -Yeah, yeah.\n-Alright, good. Alright, good.\nThat's a good jam on there. -Yeah, it's a good --\n-Techno jam. Alright, this one. What is Scott's most\nembarrassing childhood memory? -[ Chuckles ] Um -- oh, God.\nOkay, I -- -No one's going to watch.\n-Okay. [ Laughter ] I know -- [ Sighs ]\nI know what it is. Well -- it's okay.\nIt's fine. We've talked about this. Scott, as a kid, had, uh... bowel control issues. [ Light laughter ] And we were -- we were skiing\nin New Hampshire. I know this is what this is. We were skiing in New Hampshire. Me and my sister\nand my brother -- [ Light laughter ]\nAnd my father. We're skiing on the mountain.\nScott, he's like five. He probably shouldn't even\nhave been on skis. He pooped his pants. [ Laughter ] -Dude, this is the most\nembarrassing -- This is beyond embarrassing.\nOh, my God. -But --\n[ Laughter ] -Don't -- You should think of a\ndifferent story. -I say this because I know --\nooh, I hope he's okay. Maybe it's different on TV. But I've heard him\ntell this story. So my father, you know,\npicked him up. We went to the bathroom.\nMy father dumped his underwear. Back on the mountain.\nHe pooped his pants again. [ Laughter ] So back to the bathroom. Long underwear are gone. And at that point, my father was\nlike, \"Alright, day's over.\" And he went to get the car -- This is it.\n[ Light laughter ] And it was me and my sister\nand my brother waiting in the, like, the lobby of the lodge\nwhile my dad -- We're down to last line\nof defense. It's just the snow pants,\nyou know? And he starts crying, saying\nit's going to happen. [ Laughter ] And me and my sister are like,\n\"Just hang on.\" And it -- he didn't make it. You know what I mean?\n[ Laughter ] [ Rim shot ]\nAnd it happened. It happened. Without question, this is\ngoing to be the answer. -Okay, alright, oh, my gosh.\n-It's going to be the answer. Scott?\nFirst of all -- -Looking over,\nI'm seeing reactions. -No.\n-Just -- well, okay. -Look, it's all fine.\n-Is it? -Yeah.\n-I remember that last time I was here.\n-It's all going to be fine. I don't want you to get too\nexcited. [ Laughter ] Scott, what is your most\nembarrassing childhood memory? -I didn't hold back. -Alright, well --\nOh, my God. [ Laughter ] Alright. The only thing\nI can think of -- Oh, God, I wish I could think\nof something else, but now my brain is just like, \"You have nothing else\nbut this story.\" Oh, my God.\n[ Laughter ] Like, you wouldn't -- alright. I'm going to go with this.\nGod, let it be right. I was driving home -- -No! Is it bad?\n[ Laughter, audience \"oh\"s ] [ Rim shot ]\n[ Low horn, buzzer ] -No, yes! Yes, yes, that's it.\nYes, that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.\n-No, don't change -- -Oh, no! Oh, this is going to be amazing. [ Laughter ]\n-Alright, alright. Alright, we'll go, we'll go.\nLet's go. Let's go. -You're driving home.\n-Driving home from a rehearsal with my three siblings\nin a car. I was sitting in the front seat.\nI don't know how. And I -- I mean, I feel like -- okay, and I had to -- I had to\ngo to the bathroom. [ Laughter ] -Alright. Am I close? And I said -- and I begged\nmy sister, \"Pull over.\" Because I really had to go. She was like, \"Where are you\ngoing to go?\" And I was like, \"On the street.\nI will do it anywhere.\" She wouldn't pull over.\nAnd I went, like -- I went in my pants.\n[ Laughter ] [ Low horn, rim shot ]\n[ Cheers and applause ] Wow.\n[ Ding ] Wow!\n-It's Loon Mountain. -Wow.\n-Skiing. -Your Honor -- welcome back\nto \"Law & Order.\" Your Honor -- -There's been a murder.\n-There's been a murder. -I feel like --\n-I did Loon Mountain. -I feel like our client would be\nused to that situation since... Since he pooped his pants three\ntimes on the ski slope! [ Laughter and applause ] -I was sick!\n-Come here. Come here, give me --\n-To be fair -- -It's going to be okay.\nIt's going to be alright. -Well, I did it when I was 10\nthe other time. -To be fair, to be fair, Loon Mountain,\nyou were very young. That did happen. -Yeah, but the rehearsal story,\nI remember. -The rehearsal -- that wasn't\nyour fault. You -- you let us know.\n-I begged you guys to pull over! -There was no boy\nwho cried wolf. You let us know, and we\ndidn't -- -So happy to be here again.\n[ Laughter ] -Did Anthony Mackie -- I know all the scripts and all\nthe scenes are very secretive. And did he know that you were\ngoing to give him the shield? -You know, there's actually\na really great story with that. The scripts\nare so lock and key, but they had given me the scene where I pass the shield\nto Mackie. Oh, it's so nice\nto be able to say that. You know, it doesn't\nhave to be a secret. -It's like therapy. I want you to lay\ndown on the couch and just talk about\nthe Marvel secrets, yeah. -But -- But -- I did know that\nMackie was getting the shield, and while we -- This is actually\na really nice story. While we were filming\nin Atlanta, you know, I had already\nread the scene. I had a few people over to watch\na football game or something, and Mackie was the first one\nto show up. I didn't know he didn't know\nwhat was going to happen. And he showed up first,\nand I said, \"Hey, man, you know,\nisn't that scene fantastic?\" And he said, \"What scene?\" And I said, \"The -- The scene\nwhere I give you the shield.\" And he said,\n\"You're giving me the shield?\" [ Laughter ] And I said, \"Oh, no. Oh, no.\" Well, yeah.\" And so I ran\nto my room, and I got the scene, and I gave it to him, and I got\nto watch him read the scene for the first time\nwhere he's getting the shield. And he was so happy, and, you\nknow, you immediately feel like, man, maybe I -- Maybe I robbed\nthis moment from -- Maybe Kevin Feige deserved this. But it was so nice to share it\nwith him. He was so happy and, you know,\nso deserving, and it was just -- -It was a great moment. -It was a nice way\nto kind of have, just between us,\nthe transition of characters. It was great. -I got to see it\nin a theater full of people, and one of the biggest\nparts of the movie that got a big reaction was\nwhen you pick up Thor's hammer. -Yeah.\n-That was a big moment. Yeah, I mean --\nEveryone went nuts. Like, \"What?! I knew he could do it!\"\nLike, yelling. \"I knew he always --\"\nWas that -- -I don't think\nHemsworth liked it. [ Laughter ] -\"Hey, there's only one Thor,\"\nyeah. What would feel better, picking\nup the shield for the first time or Thor's hammer\nfor the first time? -Hammer.\n-Really? [ Laughs ] -Yeah. Well, you know, the shield was destined\nfor the character. The hammer was kind of this,\nyou know, period at the end of a sentence\nin terms of his worth, and, yeah, it was nice. And the Russos really know\nhow to build those moments up. -They were great.\n-I'll say the hammer. -They did such a great job\nwith that. Everyone just knocked it\nout of the park. -Alright. Here we go. Big smiles. And three, two, one. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Three, two, one. [ Camera shutter clicks ] And three, two, one. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Three, two, one.

He's, like,\nflipping around and -- -That's right. Flipping around.\n-Balance beams. -Oh, I had\na whole ribbon routine. -Yeah, of course, that's what\nwe want to see in IMAX 3D. -It was really nice.\n-Ball and ribbon? Yeah. That's what I want to see, man.\n-That didn't make it in there, but it was beautiful.\n-Bummer, bummer. -It was really nice. -But you tell me\nthat you practice parkour? -Yeah,\nWell, that was part of the -- that was part of\nthe gymnastics routine. You try to make him\njust a little bit more able and using his environment. So, we did gymnastics and\nparkour and all this. -Parkour's nuts, though. That's\nlike running up walls and stuff. -And you realize how enabled\nyou are as an individual when you see other people\njust leap and bound and you realize,\n\"I could never do that.\" -No. Yeah. It's like, you ever run into\nsomeone who's doing CrossFit? You ever heard of that thing?\n-Oh, yeah. Oh, I've heard of it.\n-Yeah. -I see it on the streets, and you think,\n\"What are you guys doing?\" -It makes me tired looking at\nposters. It makes me exhausted. But they're always like,\n\"I've been doing CrossFit,\" and then they crush your hand, and I'm like, \"Ahh, maybe you\nshouldn't do CrossFit. \"I mean, you can deal\nwith other humans. You're in too good of shape.\" I mean, do you have to work out\nconstantly during this whole movie?\n-I mean, you do have to work out.

And I think about --\nI'd say about 3 to 4 weeks prior to wrapping, you pull the plug,\nand you just say, \"I'm done completely.\"\n-Really? -Oh, yeah.\nI mean, since the last -- So, we start \"Avengers\"\nin about, I'd say, like two or three weeks.\nPrior to that, I -- [ Cheers and applause ]\nOh! -You can just -- Prior to that,\nyou can just be like -- -I mean, you don't even think\nabout going to the gym. -No.\n-It's really peaks and valleys. -You call up the director, like,\n\"Can Captain America be fat?\" -[ Laughs ]\n-\"I'm just bringing it up.\" -Maybe he's just depressed.\neating doughnuts.",

And so I switched my phone\noff 2015 and left it in a box. And then, when I went\nthrough that lawsuit, I got my phone out again and had to go through,\nlike, all the voice notes and the pictures and all that\nstuff for the lawyers. And I switched it on, and it was\nlike going into a time machine. Like, the first text\nwas my friend that had passed away\nthe year before. The second text was, like, an\nargument with an ex-girlfriend. The third text\nwas a family member I hadn't spoken to in 10 years. Fourth text\nwas another mate that died. And I was kind of, like,\nscrolling down. It really, really spun me out. And, that day,\nI wrote in my notes, like, \"I found\nmy old phone today,\" and then,\n\"Finish this as a song.\" And then I ended up\nwriting it into a song that that's the music video for,\nessentially. -Well, we always happen\nto have a guitar handy. -I did spot that.\n-Yeah. -Yeah. -If you ever feel the need\nto pick it up... -I haven't, um...\n[ Cheers and applause ] [ Guitar strums ] -Can you give us a taste of --\n-Yeah, this will be, uh...
